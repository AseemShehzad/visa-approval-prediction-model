Hi everyone. 
I wanted to share my journey. It took approximately a month. All you need to do is to stay optimistic and consistent.It takes determination , hard work and a sprinkle of luck to make it happen. 
I gave duolingo.
No GRE 
I’m on assistantship (Research assistant)
I 
applied on 12th of july got accepted within two days. I booked an emergency appointment and got a slot for 8th of August. The interview was very brief and hardly lasted for 2 minutes. I landed in state on 7th of September. 
This group helped me a lot . If any of you guys need assistance with the interview preparation or anything else feel free to reach out to me I will do my best to lend a hand . There might be moments of uncertainty and doubt , but don’t let them discourage you . Keep pushing forward and stay focused on your goals.

Update: 
My F1 visa got accepted today. The VO didn’t ask me for any documents or bank statements. 
Hey!
my appointment is on 6th September and this will be 2nd interview at Islamabad embassy (got a refusal in July). The situation was different in my first attempt as I only had a scholarship of 25% and the rest of the amount was a loan from prodigy. 
Now 
in my second attempt I have almost 60% scholarship from the university and instead of loan from prodigy, my uncles are my sponsors (my mamu and khaalu) and my I20 only mentions a 12000$ family funding. 
I was refused under 214 (b) and the VO also showed a concern about my loan repayment. 
What do you think are the chances that I can secure an F1 visa in my second attempt with all the changes in my interview? 
P.S. I already have a valid B1/B2 visa which will expire in 2027.
Thank you

Please Admin approve my post.
AOA to all of you.
I've been accepted by a professor for PhD program at the University of California, USA. I need your feedback on an important matter. The guidelines state that if you've studied in an English medium, you don't need an English test like IELTS or TOEFL. I reached out to the professor, who advised me to ask the graduate admission director, but I haven't received a response. I then contacted the graduate student affairs officer, who 
confirmed that I don't need to take the IELTS.
I'm a bit concerned about whether I should proceed without the test. The application deadline is December 1st, and need a 7-band score. Will this decision impact my application negatively? Your insights are much appreciated.

Alhamdulilah! I 
got accepted to Fully Funded Masters 
Scholarship in Computer Science from 
Canada
 as well as 
America
.
HOW YOU CAN GET IT AS WELL?
1 line answer is: "" Good and Novel Research Work "" (Publication is not required).
A bit of 
detailed method
 (How I got the scholarship):
I have 
3.3 CGPA, and NO Publications
 but my research work is meaningful that I could write about it thoroughly in my Statement of Purpose.
Conduct good and meaningful research work in your home country (it means come with a problem and spend a few months or a year in solving that problem or problems in a good university or research lab under other professors, who can guide you).
Apply in Masters Thesis Programs only.
Write Statement of Purpose which should mainly focus on your research work and future prospects and reflects why this particular professor and university is the best match with your work (relate your work with prospective supervisor in the SOP, write his research paper titles and relate it with yours in 1-2 lines).
Get 3 Letters of Recommendations from your university (these letters should support and highlight your research work and what you have written in your SOP, it should not be generic at all (as most university professors give generic letters and they are useless).
Now, Choose universities you intend to apply based on your CGPA (like if you have just 3.0, then University of Toronto's scholarship doesn't make sense in your case) and follow these steps.
Visit Faculty profiles (related to your desired department of study), of let's say 20 different universities.
See the Google scholar and Personal Website of the Professors of that department you want to apply in. 
List down which 3 professors best matches with your research work and domain in those universities.
If there is no professor which matches with your research work, then do not apply in that university.
Write about his work and relate that to your work in your SOP.
Write him an email as well (after applying) that how his work was related and how you can assist him in his work and how his work fascinates you.
It would need you to read Abstracts of his recent research papers (to write, and relate such things in SOP)
Weightage to this method is 50% and 
rest of the 50%
 is Praying to Allah
Now Wait and be good to others. 
GREAT THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES AND HELP OTHERS.

I got accepted into a kind not well-known state university(not very diversed , predominantly white ) they gave me a 12k a year scholarship. A 75% off the first semester. The total fees are around 21k$ a year for a master’s in CS. There is also 13k for room & board, supplies. They said I need to take the GRE before the end of the first semester. I know the decision is mine, but does it worth it if the university is ranked low ? How  likely are they to add more $ to the current 
scholarship if I request it? Thanks

My F-1 visa got accepted today at Islamabad consulate, Alhamdulillah. VO just asked me the reason for going to USA and what would I do with my PhD degree in future.
However, my husband's (F-2) visa got into administrative processing due to his field in TAL and his current job. He clearly explained to the VO that he wouldn't be working in the states as he is not allowed to do so. VO returned his passport with 221g and said that there's nothing to be worried about, he just needs 
to upload his resume and publications list.
Has anyone faced a similar situation? If yes, how much time did it take for F-2 processing if F-1 was already approved?

Hi everyone.
Just wanted to get some info.
I have been accepted from the following universities:
1- University of Iowa (MS Data Science)
2- 
Michigan State University (MS Data Science)
3- Wayne State University (MS Data Science & Business Analytics)
4- San Francisco State University (MS Data Science & Artificial Intelligence)
It is a cliched question, but which university should I go for, keeping factors such as living cost, tuition, job opportunities, etc. Unfortunately, haven't got any financial/graduate assistantship yet. Will it be a wise option to raise student loan from mpower/prodigy finance?

F1 Visa Interview Experience, 26th September 
Karachi Embassy  
1st Attempt, Approved and Issued 
Illinois Institute of Technology, LLM Spring semester 2024.
It 
was a smooth process from start to finish.
Vo: Good Morning, pass me your documents.
Me: Good morning, here.
Vo: Why you are going to the USA?
Me: I am going for my master's LLM from IIT.
Vo: How many universities you have applied to?
Me: I applied to 4 universities and got accepted to 3 of them with 25-50% scholarships, and one of them hasn't gotten back to me yet.
Vo: So you are going for a master's in science? (I think this was a trick to confuse me).
Me: No, I'm going for my master's in law since I did my undergrad in law.
Vo: When and where did you get your undergrad degree?
Me: From the University of London in 2021
Vo: Why don't you have a UK student visa stamp on your passport?
Me: I did my LLB via an affiliated institute in Karachi.
(During this time, she was checking my passport).
Vo: Have you ever traveled abroad?
Me: Yes, I've been to the UK and Saudi Arabia 
Vo: You got a scholarship and these are your family funds, right? (Pointing at my I20)
Me: Yes, (My total funds were more than the expenses listed on the I20).
Vo: OK, who is going to sponsor you?
Me: My father will be sponsoring me and explained all the details. 
Vo: Does your father have a visa?
Me: Yes, 
(I thought she was talking about the UK visa at this point, but she was asking about the US visa. Corrected myself and told her No).
Vo: What are your future plans?
Me: My plan is to come back and start my own practice here in international law. 
Vo: OK, I am approving your visa. You’ll get your passport within a week and here’s the slip.
These are a few tips I learned from my whole experience.
- Do your paperwork from filing your ds160 to the interview appointment. I made a slight mistake in my ds160 and changed my form before the interview. 
- Be confident during the interview, it matters a lot. They scrutinize the body language and attitude of the applicant. 
- If you're not sure, ask around in the group. I posted many times with my queries and asked members for help.
- Reach out to the universities repeatedly for your concerns, they’ll help you in every way possible.
- Watch Argo Visa Interviews, they are so helpful and accurate. 
- Take this interview as a normal interview. It’s a normal process. Usually I overthink things, but the day before the interview I stopped myself from reading interview posts and anything related to it. It eased my nerves a lot. I was way more relaxed than my family members lol.
- And the most important thing is to pray and make lots of dua. InshaAllah you’ll be fine.

I am a graduate student in USA and recently got on campus employment. My university payroll department informed me that ""Because you are from Pakistan, you are eligible for a tax treaty benefit in the amount of $5,000 per calendar year. This means that the first $5,000 of your income, if you choose to accept this benefit, will be exempt from Federal and State income taxes"". My question are 1) it is ok to accept this tax exemption. 2) whether this will have any long term 
negative impact? 3) are there hidden/not known consequences associated with accepting this exemption.  Thank you so much for your help!

Me: Good morning.
VO: Please pass me your passport and I-20, please.
Me: Here you go (handed them over).
VO: (Looking at my I-20) Are you going for your bachelor's or master's?
Me: Master's.
VO: What course?
Me: I'm going to pursue my Master's in Marketing Analytics.
VO: Okay, why this university?
Me: I chose this university because of its unique curriculum, which combines IT and Business courses with my major.
VO: How many universities did you apply to?
Me: Only Pace, because I was accepted, so there was no need to apply elsewhere.
Vo: What field did you studied in your bachelors? 
Me: Media Studies 
VO: Do you have any relatives in the United States?
Me: No, ma'am, I don't have any family members in the United States.
VO: I see that you have traveled to India as well. Why?
Me: I visited India when I was in the early 20's on my mother's passport. My mother's family and relatives are from India. I was 3-4 years old at that time.

Me: I completed my bachelor's degree in 2021.
VO: Since then, what have you been doing?
Me: I shared my activities.
VO: Alright, here's your slip. Enjoy your studies.
Me: Thank you.
I was very nervous when I arrived at the embassy, but when I went inside and saw the relaxed environment, I started feeling more at ease. The atmosphere was very comfortable, and seeing that made my confidence boost. I spoke with the Visa Officer in a friendly manner, as if I was having a conversation with a friend. I had prepared long answers, but during the interview, I only spoke when necessary and avoided giving unnecessary details.
I want to tell all of you that feeling nervous is valid. It's okay to be nervous, and that's completely normal. Just don't stress out. I can't express how nervous and stressed I was, but once I was there, the environment made it easy, and I was able to manage my nervousness. One more important thing: hold on tightly to your faith in ALLAH. Our success is not because of our efforts alone, it's by the will of Allah. Get close to Him and put your trust in Him. Pray Tahajjud and Nawafil, and have faith in every aspect of your journey. They really helped me stay relaxed.
Additionally, this group also played a significant role in helping me. If your DS-160 form is filled out correctly, you have all the required tests and documents, then you're on the right track to get your visa.

Admin please approve this post. Its a genuine question ! 
I have gotten accepted into the community college and I recently received my i-20.
So now I'm looking forward to find an appointment and in order for f-1 visa requirements I'll need many things 
but there's one thing I'm not sure and I wanted to ask y'all in the group.
So 
my father is an investor in real state and we don't have any proper income source to declare but we do have 40k usd to show bank statements 
I mean to say that we are able to show the funds but we are not able to show the income source because it's not declared to the government  but we can show the contracts of different investments in different real state but it won't be able to verify ! 
I don't live in pakistan. 
can I please know how important is a proper income source ? does it really matters? does it really needs to be declared to the government  ? 
Thanks alot

Hello,
I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s graduate program (in NYC), with a financial aid award that covers tuition, Bard-sponsored housing/accommodation, and health insurance. However, expenses related to travel and food will not be waived and I’d be entirely responsible for managing them. Moreover, the program does not have any on-campus jobs/employment (I’m not allowed to live/work off-campus) and I would quite literally be on my own. I wanted to write here 
to ask for advice: Should I say yes to this offer? Is it possible to be a bit too frugal in New York and save money/stop myself from needless spending? Would I be able to manage? How can I bring down the remaining costs that have not been covered by my financial aid award? Any sort of assistance/piece of advice is welcomed.
Thank you very much.

I applied to 2 universities back in January/Feb and got accepted in both. I went with the private one as that one was more suitable for my goals. My initial plan was to go for September intake but my university (where I completed my BS this year) didn't give me my transcript in time and I had to defer my admission. Meanwhile I noticed my passport was about to expire so I applied for a renewal in the first week of September. My initial pick-up date was 3 October but as we all 
know all passports were delayed due to Pakistan not having enough papers. The problem is I got my i-20 and everything is ready but I don't have my new passport yet and no one's giving any information when I will even receive it. Can I apply on my old passport which is about to expire in February as I don't wanna miss this intake. Or can anyone tell me when they're going to print new passports? As I have heard they haven't started printing these new passports.

I got accepted to USF(bachelors in CS) with about 12k USD scholarship/year. However, my family, at most, can contribute upto 5k USD per year. The total cost per year is about 32k USD, is it manageable to cover the rest of the costs with part time job?
P.S: I also will have to maintain my GPA to keep my scholarship valid for 4 years.

Hello, there!
In April 23, I got accepted into University of Alabama At Birmingham (UAB) and Oregon State University for MS Mechanical Engineering and Gannon University for MS Engineering Management Program. Afterwards I applied for US visa with UAB of date 26th May. Unfortunately my visa got refused under 214-B. Now I am unable to book an early appointment as the starting date of my semester is Aug, 23rd.
Now, I am thinking to apply for UK as I got 2 offers from UK 
universities as well Brunel University London (MS Automotive Engineering) and Cardiff University (MS Advanced Mechanical Engineering).
Is it a wise decision to get admitted into any of the UK university, As I don't wanna miss this opportunity aswell.
I need good advice regarding this?
Thanks!!!

Me: I chose bs business administration as i belong to a business related family, my father and brother both are successful businessmen, i have interest in business as this course will enhance my business skills as ill learn about all aspects of business including economics, marketing, supply chain and information system 
He gave a smile, seemed like he thought i was confident abt my program like know how, and stood up took my passport inside and came back
Him:Why this university?
 I did an internship at an educational consultancy where i got to know about university of UTAH then i did my research and got to know about unique majors that university is providing and big campus situated in 1526 acres, diversification of students, support system for students, i got scholarship of 35000$ across 4 years and last factor was location, which is salt lake city, it is one of the liveable cities in US and top preference for international student because of the business opportunities.
Passed me my docs with rejection slip and said sorry you’re not eligible for the visa under section 214B. 
Can anyone guide me where i went wrong as I cant seem to understand with only two questions how he rejected me. My D160 was perfect also funding and my family ties are also good as I’ll have to come back to takeover my family business.

Hello.
I have been emailing professors for positions in their respective PhD programs since April but have not gotten a positive response from anywhere. Then, a few days back, my application for a PhD program in one of the universities got accepted. Now they're asking me to upload my documents etc. How is it possible that none of the professors accepted me but I still got in? What do I do about the funding? I called the uni and they said all TA positions are taken. Everywhere 
on this group and the PhD holders from USA around me are saying that PhD is always fully funded. What am I supposed to do? I'm still emailing the professors that haven't responded from that uni.

Hello group members!
I want to do undergraduate in CS from MIT. I know it's extremely hard to land at this institution but I have a great academic record and academic achievements however I don't have done any major extra curricular activities. Alumni's of MIT suggest that you should have something in your profile that MIT lacks and you have to show them that you are able to fulfill the required gap in order to get accepted. CS is a very competitive field to get into, so 
please tell me which domain with CS combined should I choose in order to land at MIT? What extra curriculars should I do? And which thing that MIT lacks and what they are looking for in the students nowadays?
Please note that I am looking for some serious advice. So, if you don't have any advice, please don't make your input here.

Interview Experience
Islamabad Embassy, 30th July, 2021.
8 A.M
Visa Status: Approved
Profile:
University: Northeastern University
Program: MS in HR Management
Undergrad GPA: 3.75
IELTS: 8.0
Questions VO asked me:
VO: Is it a masters program?
ME: Yes, masters.
VO: Why are you going to the US?
ME: To pursue my masters degree in Human Resource Management from Northeastern University in Boston.
VO: Did you apply to any other universities?
ME: Yes, I applied to two other universities. Boston University and University of Notre Dame, in Indiana. 
VO: Were you accepted to any of those?
ME: I was rejected by Notre Dame but accepted into Boston University.
VO: Have you ever travelled abroad?
ME: No, I haven't
VO: So you have a brother in the US?
ME: Yes, my brother lives in US. He is also a graduate of Northeastern University. And is currently working there in a company. 
VO: Why did you choose to pursue this program now?
ME: Well I graduated last year with my bachelors degree. Since then I've been working in a school as an English teacher. I was made HOD of the English department & I became interested in HR management. And since there weren't many good options for this degree in Pakistan, I thought why not go to the US.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME: My father is my sponsor.
VO: What does your sponsor do?
ME: He is a recently retired police officer from Punjab police. He currently owns a pharmacy business in Lahore.
VO: Ok, I'm approving your visa. 
I found the VO to be very professional. He would interrupt most my answers by saying ""Ok got it"" when he wanted me to stop talking and I would. I was honest and confident. That's the key. Also your choice of University really matters, in my opinion. 
3 guys were rejected before me. 1 girl who went before me was approved.  They were all re-applying. This was my first attempt. 
Good luck everyone!

Hello and Eid Mubarak!
I'm planning to go for my post-grad studies this Fall-23 and have been accepted by the University of San Francisco in their Energy Systems Program. The University has offered me a $10k scholarship for the whole academic year, and the rest will be funded through student loan (cos I don't want to use my PKR savings to fund my studies). 
Total per annum expenses are (incl. living, and other expenses) $50k. (I will be showing proof of funds of around 30k; 20k 
savings account and 10k scholarship)
My questions from the community are:
1) would there be any issue in the F1 visa processing? 
2) Do i need to show complete Proof of Funds of $50k? Or should i tell them that part of the cost will be funded through student loan?
3) I'm funding my education from my own savings. My family won't be supporting me (coz they don't have that much money or source of income). I have 6 years of professional working experience. 
Your help is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

In 
first window the guy verified my documents, checked my passport and pictures. Asked me if im married and asked about how long ago the picture was taken.

Then i waited for another 20 mins for my turn for final interview. My interview guy was bald man and he was older in age.
VO: Why are you going to US?
Me: To do my PhD in Nutrition 
VO: Why this university?
Me: I have worked a lot on nutraceuticals and superfoods. When choosing a university i wanted that my phd research is also around one superfood. So now I’ll be working on soy beans.

And i have heard minneapolis is a beautiful city.
VO: ok ok and who is funding you?
Me: HEC
VO: I see that its partly funded by your university.
Me: Yes partly funded by university and rest by HEC so its completely funded.

I took the blue slip, my documents and almost ran out of the hall (as if he would catch me and give my passport back 
)
I was confident, i made sure that my answes are related to my research and reflect me and not any general answer. This is the key i think. Thank You everyone for all the support that I got.

Me: Told with clear details. I asked him if he wanted to have a look at the statement but he declined
VO: typing for a few time and than placed my passport in a file/box where there were many other passports
VO: I am issuing your visa, Congratulations 
All the time he was typing but we managed to make a good conversation, I maintained strong eye contact throughtout the interview & i was very confident. One good reason was that i was the first person to get interviewed by him. Secondly, the key to getting the visa is confidence. People have overhyped this process toooo much whereas it is just a normal conversation. 
Please donot use chatgpt and the professor thing, find some strong points regarding your university and link them to how it will help you in Pakistan.

Hi, I recently got accepted at a school in chicago for a psychology program(Masters) 
I had a couple questions, if anyone of you can help me out a little.
1- My current school is around 13k per semester; however i dont want to start studying here. Im just planning to use their i20 to get visa. Since they have a low acceptance rate, im assuming it’ll be helpful in getting the visa through them. 
Is 
it possible that i transfer to a community college before even starting my semester at my original school? 
(If yes, are there any you guys can suggest?)
2- Should i apply to these community colleges from pakistan( right now) or when i come ? (Given that i do get my visa approved) 
3- Can you give me a step to step guide as to how i will be able to transfer right away ? If anyone has been through the process, id love to hear your experience. 
(The community colleges i checked have a deadline of august 15th for fall 2023) 
4- Can i work off campus on my very first month of coming to the states or am i only allowed to work on campus( given that i will not have a SSN initially) 
Any other piece of advice you can give me, id love to hear it. Please help a sis out 
 
Thanks!

Hello,
I am from Pakistan. I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s Masters program, and received a financial aid award that does not cover personal, food and travel expenses (along with other services and amenities). I wanted to write here to ask about alternative sources of funding (both International/American and Pakistani) that could help me finance my graduate study in the United States/at Bard and cover the remaining costs. I have spoken to their financial aid 
officer, but thought it might be worth a shot, to ask here and get your suggestions. 
Thank you very much.

I’ve been refused twice for F-1 visa. I don’t know what VO is looking for. Please guide the following:
-> Should I change my university this time?
My university in previous attempts was SIUE (with 8K/year) scholarship. I’ve been accepted in Purdue Northwest (without scholarship) too, should I go with SIUE  or change it to Purdue?
-> 
My uncle were my sponsor in previous attempts. Now my principal sponsor is my father. (Circumstances changed)
Please guide what should I do as I’m a genuine student with a good profile but still they are refusing me. Should I only go with changed sponsor or should I change university too?
Profile:
BS ECE (3.43/4.00)
IELTS: 7
Been employed in Pak since graduation.
Travel history to UK under a sponsored visit.
Social Work Experience with numerous achievements.

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Embassy: Islamabad
Status : Approved
Applied by myself
After greeting, VO said my name and I nodded in response
Why are you going to US
I'm going for studies
You're going to Harvard. Great. What are you going to study?
Differential equations
Differential equations?
Yes, my concentration is differential equations although it says liberal arts on the document.
Why do you want to study these?
I'm a teacher and need to learn them so I can teach it to my students.
How was the application process?
(VO was asking about admission application and I thought he meant visa application) Most people said I should get an advisor or counsellor but I did it myself, didn't find it very complicated.
(VO interrupted) 
Did you apply and get accepted for it or just signed up?
I had to apply and go through the admission process.
OK. How do you plan to pay for it?
From my savings.
How much  do you have?
I shared the amount.
Are you married?
Yes
Any kids?
No.
Is your wife going with you?
No she's not. (I wanted to explain why, but didn't)
Have you changed your name before?
No, I haven't.
OK. It says you were Akmal (not real name) before?
My family calls me that endearly. It hasn't been my official name. 
OK I'm approving your visa. You'll get your passport in some days.
I asked how long it will take and he said its on the blue slip.
VO kept typing throughtout these questions and there were long pauses between questions. He didn't ask me for any supporting documents apart from the usual sevis fee, visa fee, DS 160 and Passport.
I was very nervous because he refused 3 people before me and only one approval. At the last minute I told myself that this person is a gatekeeper and I have to go to US nomatterwhat. I focused on why I was there and where I wanted to be, instead of focusing on people around me. Confidence is key. He could have refused me for my ans to last question but I clarified and was confident which I think helped.
ایسا لگ رہا ہے جیسے برسوں کا بوجھ ہٹ گیا ہو۔ 
I was refused visa for UK 4 years ago despite having an offer from University of Cambridge and it took me 3 years to save the money for this program.
I'd like to thank Tahir Haneef for helping me clear my doubts and for questions I had. I'd also like to thank you all for this group and the moderators. I did multiple mock interviews using different questions from previous posts here.
BTW nobody tells you about the whole gruesome process of going to shuttle stop, the exorbitant fee for it, multiple queues and security checks. The embassy building is daunting. Also, from the moment I stepped out of embassy to until I left the shuttle stop, every person I met asked me for mithayi after seeing the blue slip. I hope our workers learn some self respect and stop the begging.

I was rejected for this upcoming fall semester. 
To improve my application, I need to find a good ranked university.
The MS programs I am looking for are
Data science
Data analytics
Business Analytics
Computer science
Unfortunately my CGPA was 2.95. But I have a over 2 years of relevant work experience. Hence looking for names where i can get accepted with the CGPA and without mandatory GRE.
After my research many universities are saying that they might consider, but they usually don't. Had the same experience last term alot of money was wasted on application fees.
I will be very thankful if someone suggest me good universities with good rank for the spring semester.

By any chance does Visa Officer know how much Universities did I applied to?
Cause I have applied at only one and have been accepted there, but I'm worried that applying to only one university may give VO the wrong impression.
So when he asks, How much Universities did you applied to?
Can 
I say that I applied to Three other Universities with (name and details about them)?

Dear Group Members,
One of the professors from University of Florida has accepted me to enroll in a PhD project under her supervision. The project is fully funded. Also, she has offered me to work as a teaching assistant at the department as well. 
Currently, I am clueless about the next steps (e.g., Visa processing and documentation). I would really appreciate if you all could guide me on the following points:
1) 
What type of visa options are available in my case? I am married and would take my spouse with me.
2) Besides degrees, passport and acceptance letter, what other documents would be needed?
3) How long does the whole process take?

Hi everyone 
 
What is the visa appointment availability these days for F1 at Islamabad embassy?
How can I check it myself? Can someone please guide? Sorry if my question is stupid.
I’m 
targeting spring intake and have acceptances from multiple universities. But I’m trying to get into this other university so wanted to ask that should I wait for completing the application and wait for their decision and then fulfill the I20 requirements or just chose from the universities that have accepted me?
What I want to ask is that if getting the I20 from this other university takes around 15-20 days more, would that hinder my prospects of booking an appointment on time??

Hello everyone. (Admin please approve)
I got acceptance from Temple University and Fordham University for masters. Both of them have a good reputation and both have granted me almost 50% scholarship. My tuition and living expense after the scholarship is $45,000. Firstly, i want to know do we have to pay any prior initial fee to receive the i-20 from the university or any other fee that we have to pay to the university before the visa approval or not? I have heard we only have 
to pay the initial deposit when we start our classes/attend school. 
Secondly, me and My father do not have any prior bank statement. We do have the funds that we can deposit into our bank account but will such statement will be accepted by the university or the embassy during the interview, as it will only be a month old statement. Apart from this i also have an option to submit an affidavit of support from my current employer and my uncle in pakistan. Both are willing to sponsor me and i can use their bank statements too. 
Therefore, please let me know which will be the best option for visa approval, using my own statement that will only be a month old or having a employer as a sponsor or my uncle? 
Any suggestion or guidance will mean alot! 
Regards.

I've got admission in a US university for spring intake. Meanwhile, I have also been accepted for a good Korean scholarship. I am going to apply for a US visa in September or October depending upon the slot. So the question is should I go to Korea now and apply for the US visa from there (is it possible?). Or should I just give up the Korean scholarship and just apply for the US from Pakistan? 
Please advise.

Date: 26 September
Embassy: Islamabad
Status: approved (I had a prior refusal in 2022 in B2)
Appointment time: 7:45
The 
embassy was quite empty when I arrived and I believe I was the 4th or 5th person in the interview when counters opened.
Visa officer was a young American lady and pretty nice and friendly.
VO: Good morning! How are you doing?
Me: I am fine thank you for asking. How are you?
VO: I’m good. Why are you going to US?
Me: I’m going there to pursue my masters in business analytics from the University of Central Oklahoma.
Me: alright! Why did you choose this uni?
Me: Actually my sister referred this university to me initially since she is already studying in the US and then I researched about it from my end as well. I found the coursework to align quite well with my future goals because I plan to join the banking sector of here as a business analyst and there was this specific course of predictive analytics I really wanted to study since it is quite useful in the banking sector and UCO offered it so I went with it and everything seemed good. I also scored a partial scholarship.
VO: Ok so two of your sisters study over there?
Me: No my elder sister is studying over there only.
VO: And what is she studying over there?
Me: she is doing her associate in nursing.
VO: who is sponsoring her?
Me: my father.
VO: so he is also going to sponsor you right?
Me: Yes entirely
VO: What does he do?
Me: He is a senior executive at a bank over here.
VO: which bank?
Me: Bank of Punjab, it’s a government bank.
VO: what is his exact grade?
Me: Executive vice president.
VO: Nice. Do you have any travel history?
Me: Yes I went to Saudi Arabia in 2016 with my entire family and recently went to UAE in December 2022.
VO: Great. Do you know anyone else in the US?
Me: not from my fast family but my brother in law is also over there.
VO: I see. (Spent almost 30 seconds typing something on the computer and then came the final verdict)
VO: congratulations your visa has been approved. Thank you for coming. You will receive your passport in almost a week. Have a nice day.
Me: Thank you so much. Have a nice day!
The overall time of interview was 4-5 mins I think at max and the entire time, I tried my best to stay confident and keep a nice smile on my face. The officer was quite understanding and took interest in what I said. Also, main thing is surprisingly all 3 people before me and 2 people after me got their visa accepted.
This group honestly helped me a lot in the preparation and even though I was quite nervous till the end (because I had a few weak things in my case; my sister was studying in the US, her daughter was born there and is a US national, my entire family already has valid visas, I have been previously refused), I believe I aced the interview. 
Also, ARGO Visa’s Youtube channel is honestly very very useful.

My current role is a Project Manager at an international NGO. I'm considering presenting the NGO as my sponsor and including their bank statement. Which choice would you recommend 1. personal funds or 2. Organization as sponsor?

Interviewer was a short haired blondie on counter 3
***PS. The interview was long as I tried to drag it as much as possible, so I will try to write as much as I can remember bear with the long post I hope it can be helpful***
Me: Hello
VO: Hey, how are you?
Me: I am good, I hope you are doing well too.
VO: thank you, May I have your picture
Me: Sure, here you go?
VO: How much time has passed since you got this captured?
Me: Maybe 2 months or a little over I don’t remember exactly.
VO: Is your picture edited?
Me: Oh yes, I guess it is as I got it taken at a studio
VO: Alright, may I have your documents please?
Me: You mean the bundle they made at first security check?
VO: Yeah that’s the one
Me: Here you go!
VO: Thank you (takes a glance at my documents and started typing away on her computer vigorously)
Me: Pleasure is all mine!
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going for higher studies, masters in civil engineering precisely.
VO: (continues typing while asking) Which university did you applied to?
Me: Oh I applied to 4 universities and got accepted at Lamar university
VO: Where else did you applied to?
Me: I applied at 3 other universities *told the names*, I originally planned to go for bridgeford but the communication with them was not so efficient and Lamar had swift responses so I thought why not!
VO: Can you tell me about your bachelors course?
Me: You mean the whole curriculum or the background of what it was about?
VO: Yeah the background (still focusing on her computer)
***BTW a handful tip try to get the interviewers’ attention because that is actually an indication that she is interested in knowing about you and most likely to grant you a visa so stop making robotic internet responses come up with your own originality***
Me: I explained about my bachelors and research major
VO: Ok so who is funding your studies?
Me: Well ofcorse my father is funding my studies as I am a student and I don’t work plus I also was able to get scholarship on merit basis
VO: What does your father do?
Me: He is a businessman
VO: What kind of business he runs?
Me: Oh he rents out heavy machineries for road carpet finish and supplies bitumen.
VO: Sorry, what bitumen?
Me: Uh you know the finish product of the road, small black rocks used for carpeting the roads.
VO: Oh yeah I got that, so why did you chose civil engineering for masters?
(She was continuously typing at this point too and I was trying to drag the convo as much as I can so she can start talking to me actually face to face)
Me: Ok so the story goes way long back, my father supported and encouraged me a lot regarding my education and such as I have no brother he placed all his expectations on me in this regard and trained me for such so that when I grow up I can help him with the business handling and that’s the reason it became my passion to actually learn about what my father does and to help him improve I wanted to learn about it from a worldly aspect so that we can adapt the technology and methods used around the world.
VO: Oh wow that’s cool!
(She glanced at me and started typing away again and I stood there waiting but seconds felt like hours and it felt like the pause was too long so I started talking again)
Me: While doing my thesis I got lucky and my bachelors research preprint got published too which was a milestone for me.
VO: (finally she leave her computer leaned on the table and turned her whole attention towards me and that felt like an achievement at that moment TBH) Tell me more about it.
Me: So my research was about the airport management at Karachi Jinnah Intl Airport and its aspects.
VO: How is airport management related to what you want to study?
Me: Yeah the infrastructure and management aspect you know.
VO: Ohhh now that’s cool, Congratulations your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you!
***She was giving me the yellow approval slip alongwith my documents bundle from the small window and suddenly stopped either ends of the documents in each of our hands***
VO: When does your classes start?
Me: Oh they start from 17th Jan 2023.
VO: Alright you are free to go
(I took the document and went straight outside without seeing back and out where I cam from in)
***Remember you can be nervous it doesn’t matters because the officers are well aware of that no matter how hard you try to hide it it’s just going to get worse so do not bother with that but don’t lose your composure in the process this is the thing you need to work on. Never ever express your gratitudes and emotions and joyness when your visa gets approved as it is going to convey that you are desperate and most highly chance of getting rejected because they can do it that is what they are checking from the very beginning till the end, they are not interested in you because of all those robotic answers they hear all day long so make them actually talk to you, and last but not the least recite some duas for ease all the time on the way to the embassy till you stand in front of the interviewer, don’t think about acception or rejection that’s the main thing and you will automatically start to talk without any hesitation***
That’s all for now if you have any further questions feel free to ring my inbox and best of luck for thise who have upcoming interviews believe in Allah have faith in yourself and ace the interview afterall you are paying a hefty amount just to get to talk with the person and still you have to be nervous from thise who are taking your money, give yourself a prep talk and you are good to go.
Best Regards

VO: Who is your sponsor?
My sponsor is xyz and he has a business based in pakistan. (Gave some details of his business here to avoid usual follow up questions regarding sponsor. 
VO: Your visa is approved. 
The interview was of one minute at max. I had an upper hand because of being a issued a tourist visa earlier but most people were getting accepted that day. 
A few pointers for people who would be applying:
- Aim for universities that have a QS ranking of under 500. 
- Apply to multiple universities (3-5) as it shows the student's interest in studying. 
- Try applying to a field that is related to your current work experience or undergraduate degree. 
All they really see is the student's authenticity and his ability to come back after studies. If they have any doubt about the student staying there or going to earn money, they will reject your visa. 
All the best, may Allah make the process easy for everyone.

Hello!
Need a favour!
Is printed I-20(computerized signed) accepted for the traveling purpose or do we need to get original hard copy from the university using international courier service which costs around $75?
Kindly answer this query or share your experience, if you have any on it.
Thank you in advance.

Hello Everyone!
I need some guidance from you seniors. I've been accepted as a freshman at the University of Akron with a 60% scholarship. My major is CIS, and I'm planning to minor in Polymer Engineering. I chose this university because it's ranked as the number one polymer engineering department in the world by EduRank. 
Now, here's the catch. I had a previous F1 visa refusal from the Karachi consulate when I applied for a community college. I had determined to reapply now 
because I've changed my university and scored a great scholarship. I'm feeling more confident this time around, fingers crossed!
But here's things get a little complicated. My relative filed an immigration petition for our whole family (F4 category) a whopping 16 years ago, and it's still stuck at the NVC. Crazy, I know! They're saying the Islamabad embassy is swamped with a huge backlog, so it might take another 2 to 4 years for our case to be processed. The problem is, immigrant visas are only valid for 6 months, which means I can't go to any other country to study because I won't be able to complete my degree there. So, my only viable options are to study either in Pakistan or the US.
Now, the dilemma I'm facing is that having a pending immigration petition for a green card is a major red flag when applying for a non-immigrant visa (F1). I am 17, so the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) says I can still be eligible for a green card even if I turn 21 before it's approved. But how do I convince the consular officer to issue me an F1 visa with this red flag hanging over my head? 
So, my question to you all is that how can I overcome this hurdle and get my visa issued? Any tips on building strong ties while having a pending immigration petition for a green card? I'm all ears!
