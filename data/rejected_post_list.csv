Hello there! 
My visa was rejected twice in 2021(transfer student) when i was still in 5th semester of my University doing bachelors. Now I've completed my undergrad in 2022 and have an year experience with Toyota in my field. 
Should I reapply for MS/MBA. Seeing that I wasn't granted visa two times, will the VO make sure i don't get it third time? 
I have property and apartments on my name. I run a business too and have a full time job. 
Need 
some guidance, Kindly. 
I'm highly confused. 
Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

Vo: is he married?
Me : he married in pakistan about 4 years ago
Vo: *thinking*
Me:  your visa is rejected , ( failed to show ties to home country)
Anyways, didnt apply to US again after this and applied for canada through SDS and i got accepted.
If you dont get accepted in US in the first try, rather than begging them in 2nd or 3rd try for a visa , just change your country because some of us are not born with silver spoons in our mouth , nor have any businesses to show ties.

Visa Rejection and Approvals (F-1) 
Dear community, 
I have received 3 F visas in the past with no rejections. I have noticed people sharing their profiles and asking why those that have gotten visas think they were rejected. So with that, please take my advice as it suits you. 
1) 
Are you a genuine student? 
You should ask this question to yourself because life in US is not what is shown in Hollywood movies. Life is very challenging there and you being a genuine student means not increasing more issues for yourself. You can’t just change statuses easily, you can’t just start working there, you can’t just marry there, all these who create this illusions in your mind are not truthful. If your intent is to not study than do not consider applying for F visas. 
2) Can you really pay for a university that’s not offering you any scholarship?
With how the economy is of Pakistan, VO knows real well whether you will be able to pay or not. Don’t think you can just work there and pay for Tuition, health insurance, food, rent, bills, and save. You can’t do that on a 20 hour job. Also, it’s hard in a lot of universities now to get jobs and you can’t work off campus, so plan very very carefully. Don’t get yourself in that mess where you are stuck! If you can’t pay for your Tuition don’t lie about it. If you know your parents won’t be able to pay don’t get yourself in a bad shape. It’s better to go a little later with a better financial package than trying to hurry and than being in bad shape.
3) Getting rejected and immediately running for the next appointment 
Mainly those of you that get rejected are getting rejected on showing weak ties. You can’t just suddenly improve your ties in a week. Don’t rush the situation. Give yourself time to see what went wrong, is it really the university or is it that it was pretty obvious during interview that you won’t be able to pay as you say you will be or you were caught in a lie. Don’t underestimate the ability of VO to know about the circumstances. They are really good at scanning people, that’s what they do all day everyday. So lying about a situation will only get you refusals. When you get refused don’t panic and run for the next available appointment. Try to see what you can change depending upon what went wrong in your interview. 
4) Stay away from consultants! 
Applying for US visa and universities is pretty easy. It’s getting a good financial package is what’s difficult. So stay away from consultants!! They mostly are there to drain your money! I got three F visas and never went to a consultant. 
5) keep faith in yourself 
I know it’s easier for me to say that. But, losing faith in yourself will only put you in worst shape than what you are in. Always know, there are tons of places around the world where you can go study. One country is not what will define your future. Always take a step back and try applying to other countries. You might be able to get a really good package somewhere else. So don’t drain yourself emotionally or mentally! 
I hope this helps those who have been rejected and those that will apply in near future

I was rejected for this upcoming fall semester. 
To improve my application, I need to find a good ranked university.
The MS programs I am looking for are
Data science
Data analytics
Business Analytics
Computer science
Unfortunately my CGPA was 2.95. But I have a over 2 years of relevant work experience. Hence looking for names where i can get accepted with the CGPA and without mandatory GRE.
After my research many universities are saying that they might consider, but they usually don't. Had the same experience last term alot of money was wasted on application fees.
I will be very thankful if someone suggest me good universities with good rank for the spring semester.

Interview date = 11 Aug
Location = Karachi consulate 
Status = rejected 
V.O= young Chinese man
Time slot = 9.00 am
University = NYIT, Manhattan campus
Scanned passport and fingerprints
VO started looking at computer and then looked at me. He repeatedly did that  3 to 4 times. Then he asked 2 questions only. 
First Question = Why did you apply to this course? 
Answer = I have previously done BBA and now I'm planning to do MBA in order to polish my skills and expand my father's business in the global market. 
2nd = How did you find this university? 
Ans= I had previously done BBA from Lahore and now wish to study abroad for a global mindset, specially in a metropolitan city. So I searched for MBA program on Masters portal amd filtered my search for New York. (VO said Ok). I found a bunch of high ranked universities and then studied their ranking and course structure (VO said Ok as if it was enough) and this university matched my requirements. (Again Ok). Also,... (I was speaking in my flow but I realized that he had basically stopped me at this point. So I said Ok and stopped).
He asked me to go back and sit.
After some time I was taken into a seperate room where a Pakistani consular came and talked to me in Urdu.
I greeted him and he straight forward started like consider this a chance for yourself. I kept on agreeing with a smily face until he asked me which consultant did you use? I disagreed and told him that I had done everything by myself. However,  I have seeked some help from a friend as in discussions but nothing else. He continued this interogation for quite some time but my answers remained the same. He told me that I had matching profile with a lot of other candidates and that he has been dealing with them regularly. In fact, a lot of stidents with the same profile had come earlier and agreed that they used a consultant. I told him that a friend of mine has also come here with me and we have discussed things together if that is what you are looking for. But he remained insisting that there were many and that they've agreed to a consultant. I never agreed and he let me out and after some time, I got my passport back with white slip(214B).rejected.
Previously, my friend (whose appointment was at 8 15) was also interogated but for a longer duration than me. He claims that they showed him the exact location of the consultancy on computer screen. This did not happen with me nor he showed any other proof.
Also, I'd like some suggestions if I should go again with the same profile or change university and then apply for the next intake (January)? I'd really like to go in this intake but not sure if I'll be rejected again since I can't change my uni at this point!

Interview Advice for those who got rejected in first Attempt.
You may go with the same university but not with the same profile. VO will must ask you what circumstances have you change this time?
Circumstances mean ur academic, professional, financial or personal circumstances…University is not ur circumstance. 
Try to identify the reason of rejection, improve ur profile accordingly and then apply again with a gap of minimum one month for next attempt for same intake
Re-apply 
with no change in ur circumstances would be a waste of time and money.

"

Could someone please explain why my visa was rejected? I have provided the entire conversation below for reference.
VO Identity : Long beard Man 
Location : Islamabad 
Question: Why did you choose MIU or why MIU?
Me: MIU is economical and I can afford it easily right now. I am trained in banking software development, and there are only 32 of us who know the banking software development technology. Their course focuses on Oracle JAVA (Banking software development), which I have 
been working on for 5 years, making it beneficial for my career. My current company has committed to promoting me to a managerial position if I complete an MS in Java, so it is a great opportunity for me. He says ""Wow, great.""
Me: If you want to see it, I have a commitment letter from my company. He says ""No need.""
Me: Additionally, MIU's curriculum involves studying only one subject and taking exams at the end of each month. Also, MIU offered us CPT.
Question: I saw on your F1 Form you need $. Who will pay this fee?
Me: Sir, I am on self-finance. It's my savings, and if I need more for the next year, my father is a landlord, and he will easily pay this fee.
Question: How many universities have you applied to?
Me: Four (Drake Uni, MIU, and Mississippi Uni).
He: And which university has selected you?
Me: Drake and MIU.
He: Then why didn't you choose Drake?
Me: Actually, MIU responded first, so I continued my process with MIU.
Question: In your DS_160, I see you already did MSCS. Then why do you want to start MS again?
Me: Sir, actually, I already told you that I have been working on Java for 5 years, and my MS was in Data Science. There is no future for data science in Pakistan, so I want to start MS again, but in Java.
then he start typing completely silence  for 2 mints then i startd talking
additionally sir,  I follow Dr. abc on Google Scholar. I have published six papers internationally, so his research papers are relevant to my research, and if my visa application is approved, I'll work with him in the future.
Question: In which field did you publish your research papers?
Me: Data Sciences.
And then he gave  me a yellow rejection paper.

F1 Visa Interview 
Status: Rejected
Consulate: Karachi
15/12/2022 8:30AM
Counter 7 Young American guy without beard
Students before me for undergraduate programs were rejected and one student for masters degree was accepted only. 
Me: Good Morning officer!
Him: Why this course?
Me: I chose bs business administration as i belong to a business related family, my father and brother both are successful businessmen, i have interest in business as this course will enhance my business skills as ill learn about all aspects of business including economics, marketing, supply chain and information system 
He gave a smile, seemed like he thought i was confident abt my program like know how, and stood up took my passport inside and came back
Him:Why this university?
 I did an internship at an educational consultancy where i got to know about university of UTAH then i did my research and got to know about unique majors that university is providing and big campus situated in 1526 acres, diversification of students, support system for students, i got scholarship of 35000$ across 4 years and last factor was location, which is salt lake city, it is one of the liveable cities in US and top preference for international student because of the business opportunities.
Passed me my docs with rejection slip and said sorry you’re not eligible for the visa under section 214B. 
Can anyone guide me where i went wrong as I cant seem to understand with only two questions how he rejected me. My D160 was perfect also funding and my family ties are also good as I’ll have to come back to takeover my family business. 
Ps: i applied on basis of my o level grades

To the people getting rejected: I know it may seem like that you are rejected for no reason and many of you have posted sharing your concerns that you are rejected and have expressed your frustration too. So let me explain you the major reason. Before I explain you the reason let me tell you that I have received two F visas and one J visa with no travel history before my first visa. Currently I am doing my PhD. So one of the major reason is Finances.
Let’s be honest when you 
show bank statements, are you really going to be using those finances? And VO knows that! They know that the 70 lacs you are showing many of you don’t intend to use that money and just showing it to get the visa. After you get the visa, you will start thinking how you will pay for your education. So if you don’t have a full-ride or a loan, or a TA or RA ship you won’t be able to pay for your education. Don’t be misled thinking that you will be able to make sufficient money with an on-campus job, the on-campus job is only sufficient enough to pay for some of your expenses such as food, bills and sometimes rent. You can’t pay tuition and health insurance with a part time job and working full-time or working off-campus during semesters is ILLEGAL! Majority of you are rejected primarily because of your finances because your finance story doesn’t make sense. VO knows the cost of living in US, and cost of tuition, they are mentioned on your I-20. So they are well aware that you won’t be able to furnish this amount and the bank statement that you showed is probably just to show so you can get that visa. 
Yes, not getting the visa is disappointing. But it will be more disappointing once you get to US and can’t pay for your expenses. So again if you don’t have a full-ride, A TA/RA offer or majority tuition scholarship, don’t think that you will be able to manage the finances. 
Hope this helps and clears some doubts. Don’t blame the embassy or the system because if you are eligible for visa, you will get one but if you know deep down that “I am just showing these statements to get visa, I won’t be using this money” than know that VO knows this and you won’t get the visa. 
Best of luck!

Rejected 
University of arizona 
Bacholars
Please everyone read it and let me know what can I improve in next interview and what were my mistakes because my classes will Start soon and I can't delay them, I already had a gap year.
Vo:show me your documents
Me: passed them
Vo: financial statement 
Me: passed them
Vo: this is just a bunch of papers
( I didn't knew what to answer about it, like I can not bring money here obviously it have to be on paper) whatever
Me: explained that this is my mother's account and it has money generated from her school/collage.
Vo: which school
Me: named the school
(It's a local school)
Vo: started typing the name of school on computer, maybe he was searching about the school.
Vo: which university 
Me: university of Arizona 
Vo: how did you got to know about it?
Me: searched about good ranking universities and so
Vo: what will you study 
Me: software engineering 
Now here I am a little confused, I can not remember what he asked for, maybe my future plan or maybe why I want to study software engineering.
Me: I proceeded to explain him that I what to convert my mother's school and collage in IT University, as all great university are in lahore  islamabad and karachi, for computer and faislabad is deprived of great universities, so students have to migrate from there to other cities which everyone can not afford. And many parents don't allow and students also have safety problem.
Vo: that's more than enough
(The reality is that, EVERYTHING I SAID HERE WAS A LIE, I DONT WANT TO PROCEED WITH THE UNIVERSITY, I WANT TO OPEN A SOFTWARE HOUSE IN PAKISTAN, but I thought that he might not be convinced with software house as it can be opened anywhere and not necessarily in pakistan, so lied about the university. I think this was kind of biggest mistake, as the person before me gave the same kind of Statement 
Like good country man, help my nation, help my brother, help My country, blah blah, something like this, so my statement also seems kind of fake created, that I want to help people of my city.)
Proceeding
Vo: any relatives there
Me: no
Vo: have you been there before
Me: no
Vo: siblings 
Me: one is AS and second one in 7th class
Vo: father
Me: banker in ...... bank 
Me added we have rental home from where get rent.
(This was not true but i had to justify the bank statement soo) 
Vo: how many
Me: 4
That's what I remember, 
Then he took some time, disappear to side or somewhere, then proceeded to give the yellow paper, 
The paper said that I could not establish ties with my country, and I am not proving that I will return.
Now things I am planning to change. 
1. Tell them the real aim, of building software house
2. Take my ntn, proof which shows that there is a school which is on my mother's name.
What else should I improve, please share your valuable views.
"
41,"
Hi I had my visa rejected a week ago based on failure to show ties to home country 214b. To avoid this situation in next interview can I show one of followings in next interview for strong case:
1. An employment letter from a company existing in my village ( my current employer is an MNC which won't provide such a letter)
2. Stating I have wife and children living with parents here ( showing marriage certificate and birth certificates)
3. Father owned lands in my village ( can 
show ownership documents)
4. Stating that my father is retired and he wants to invest his savings in my so I study well and come back to support family ( can show retirement letter etc)
If anyone has better idea please suggest.

Can I change university and go with the same sponsor or not? 
Actually, my father in Pakistan has no cash money in bank and all are invested in property.
So, I have no bank statement in Pakistan

Looking for the genuine help! 
I've been rejected twice in the F1 Visa interview at Karachi Consulate (1st by Chinese VO, 2nd by 1st counter American with slightly bald personality).
I have 100% scholarship from the university for my masters. I've applied to only one school though. 
Should I apply for the third time with the same profile or leave it?
I'm just concerned that I don't want to change my university, but what should I say when the VO will ask ""What Circumstances Have You Changed This Time?"".

Questions VO asked me:
VO: Is it a masters program?
ME: Yes, masters.
VO: Why are you going to the US?
ME: To pursue my masters degree in Human Resource Management from Northeastern University in Boston.
VO: Did you apply to any other universities?
ME: Yes, I applied to two other universities. Boston University and University of Notre Dame, in Indiana. 
VO: Were you accepted to any of those?
ME: I was rejected by Notre Dame but accepted into Boston University.
VO: Have you ever travelled abroad?
ME: No, I haven't
VO: So you have a brother in the US?
ME: Yes, my brother lives in US. He is also a graduate of Northeastern University. And is currently working there in a company. 
VO: Why did you choose to pursue this program now?
ME: Well I graduated last year with my bachelors degree. Since then I've been working in a school as an English teacher. I was made HOD of the English department & I became interested in HR management. And since there weren't many good options for this degree in Pakistan, I thought why not go to the US.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME: My father is my sponsor.
VO: What does your sponsor do?
ME: He is a recently retired police officer from Punjab police. He currently owns a pharmacy business in Lahore.
VO: Ok, I'm approving your visa. 
I found the VO to be very professional. He would interrupt most my answers by saying ""Ok got it"" when he wanted me to stop talking and I would. I was honest and confident. That's the key. Also your choice of University really matters, in my opinion. 
3 guys were rejected before me. 1 girl who went before me was approved.  They were all re-applying. This was my first attempt. 
Good luck everyone!

VO was lady rejected F1 student before me.
Fingerprints done after 3 attempts
It was a very long interview.
*Note*There is possibilities that the sequence of questions might be incorrect.
My interview went very smoothly even beyond my expectations. and I was very confident.
VO: Why you specifically want to study in USA?
Me: Officer its quite different from other countries. you guys believe in giving practical exposure along with research opportunity and I really want to explore the multicultural environment of USA. apart from this usa degree will give me competitive advantage here back in Pakistan with tremendous job opportunities. 
So I will definitely experience a good learning environment. 
VO: oh so want to explore the culture as well with smile..
Me: yes Officer university life is not all about studies and I want to explore the cultural diversity of USA.
VO: thats great..
VO: you applied to any other colleges.
Me: yes Officer I applied to DePaul university, Hofstra university, UIC, southern new samphire university and Adelphi university. 
VO: So why you chose DePaul University?
Me: There were a few things that I had in mind for my university selection. The curriculum should have a dedicated career track in business analytics with real time problem solving subjects like capstone and management internship and for these courses recently depaul university has launched beta lab. It’s a virtual platform for students to solve business problem by implementing real world data using different softwares such as SAP, Oracle Tableau and power BI. Also I’m particularly interested business intelligence and big data analysis and Don Pitchell who director of business analytics program is one the top researchers in the area. So If I would get a chance to work under him as a research assistant it would be greater opportunity for me. 
VO: okay… 
Me: yes Ma’m I have also done extensive research prior to applying at DePaul University. 
VO: ohh so you have contacted any students.
Me: yes Officer I have contact with current student and I found out that students can actually interact directly with professor rather than their TA, I mean what else do I need student right.
VO: How this will relate with you future goals? 
Me:I want to pursue career as a business analyst, which is the fastest growing field literally in every sector of Pakistan. as we’re still developing country and there is a huge market gap in Building tech industry. I will definitely get a good return out of the investment. 
But Officer… 
VO: yeah continue..
Me: My ultimate vision  is to get 3 to 4 years of experience and I will start up my own business consultancy firm. as you know business has been suffered alot in the pandemic and due to lack of disastrous management and modern analytical tools.
VO: is there any family member or other relative in USA. 
Me: No Officer there is no one in USA from my family.
VO: I can see you have been rejected before. 
Me: yes Officer I was nervous because it was my first visa interview and I couldn’t answer to questions that were asked to me and visa officer was not satisfied with my answers and this time I have changed the approach to explain my self.
 VO: have you considered any other country like Canada, UK and Pakistan. 
Me: No Ma’m haven’t considered Pakistan because there a few university that are currently offering Business analytics program and I would hardly get research opportunity and practical exposure. So I will definitely experience a good learning environment. 
VO: what about fundings?
Me: My father is sponsoring me he has savings of *** and *** immovable assists for my studies and part from this I have got 5000 dollar scholarship.

Hello Aslawalakum To all members.
My interview was on 22th December .Karachi Conusulate Counter number 6.
Visa Rejected.
Me: Good Morning Sir.
Vo:Rude korean guy no reply.
Vo: 
Pass me your i20 and passport.
Me: Yes sure sir with very smile.
Vo:Why Us?
Me: US is famous for their quality of education and technology. Bachelor's degree from the USA is highly recognized back here in Pakistan. Thats why, i want to pursue my bachelors in computer science from the USA and come back to Pakistan and start a training and IT consultancy firm.
Vo: Nice , Why this university?
Me: It is a highly ranked university in the USA. They have small size classes and highly talented faculty. They focus on student learning and growing and also provide internships so you can get real world experience during your degree. Also another reason would be that based on my academic profile this university has offered me 70% scholarship. I believe I can learn alot from St Thomas university and bring it to my country and share that culture and knowledge.
Vo: Is there any relative in Minnesota?
Me: No sir .
Vo: Here is your passport good luck for next time.
Please Tell me what should i do now?
Actually my ds 160 payment was done by my brothers friend and also sevis fees was paid from an American card ,he is living in st thomas university.
What should i do now?
This korean is very rude at counter number 6.
Can anybody help me in this situation as i am under 18. My academics results are all A*.

Suggestion Needed! 
I got rejected for my F1 Visa in the first attempt. VO asked me about my finances and I told her that I'm self-sponsoring myself and that I got the money from my father. She also asked about my employment where I told her that I'm currently unemployed. Before all of you guys start lecturing me how terrible my answers were, I already know that. So, kindly give me suggestions what should I change for my 2nd interview. 
1. Should I show my father as my sponsor 
the next time? If yes, than should I show his bank statement or mine. I have the money in my own account currently. The problem with this case is that my father is a businessman but as most of the businesses in Pakistan, the documentation is not proper and I can't prove the source of these funds. 
2. My uncle has a multinational company which is strongly related to my field. I could show him as the sponsor and show strong financial documentation.  
Kindly tell me which scenario would make my case strong.

I'm an international student in the US. I got married in January. My husband applied for student visa but his visa got rejected (that was a month before we got married). A lawyer suggested that I should sponsor him on F2 visa. 
Can someone please guide me about what kind of questions they ask during the F2 visa? I've studied about the process but I'd like to know about the personal experience of someone here regarding F2 visa
Please guide me
Thank you

My wife was interviewed at karachi embassy for F2.
First time : rejected in Jan 23
Main reason : university has not updated my information on the system 
2nd time : 28apr23
At 
the end all questions, they simply said you are not eligible. 
My wife asked could you please tell me the reason , the interviewer said “ you should better know the reason”. 
My current status is F1 OPT 1st year ( still not H1B) and I am working as full time employee. 
 What was the original problem with the profile ?

Handed my yellow slip with 214g. 
There was an energetic guy who was attempting third time for his undergrad with almost 45k yearly scholarship. He got his visa. 
I feel that between the time I paused and should be talking and giving him more information. 
The interview was smooth and I must say it wasn’t my best shot. 
Looking for suggestions for my second attempt. 
What should I change?

Hello everyone,
My spouse had an appointment yesterday for J-2 Visa. But it was rejected on the basis of cousin marriage.  Our marriage was held last year in Pakistan before my arrival in the USA. But the Embassy Councelor told my wife that cousin marriage is not allowed to get Visa as per Texas State rule.
Please can someone guide me what should be the possible way to solve this matter?
Thanks and Regards
