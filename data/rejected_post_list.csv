Alert 
My visa was rejected third time yesterday. 
I went for 3rd attempt after 45 days since second attempt. 
Visa 
officer said I can't give you visa because you were rejected two times before but I give you one advice, "" Don't waste your 185$, you will get same answer. Just give yourself some time "". 
Note: I changed universities in all three times. I knew this could be red flag but i thought as long as i have explanation, it won't be an issue. And I was laid off two months before than interview. So I appeared unemployment there but had two years of work experience. 
Question: I have to wait but how long ? Even if i waited, there is strong possibility that i won't get visa because now i have three rejections.  
I'm going to start my another job soon. 
I'm thinking for Fall 2024. 
What else should I do ? 
I'm worried even if i change my profile and waited, still they may reject by seeing three rejections. 
Betray by seeing rejections but don't want to give up. 
Please give me suggestions.

Hi everyone, 
I appeared for f2 visa and unfortunately it's rejected. Interviewer was lady in Islamabad embassy. 
I need some suggestions to improve for the next time.
Here are the questions that she asked. 
1st 
question:  What is your spouse studying?
Ans: He is doing his PhD from .... university majoring in ...... Engineering 
2nd Questions: when did you guys got married?
Ans: we got married on .... 2023 
3rd Question: how did you guys meet? 
Ans: Mam he was my first cousin so we both knew each other from childhood 
She said something about cousins marriage that I didn't understand because she was not audible to me. And she rejected. 
For F2 visa I don't have anything to change in my visa application. Mostly in the posts people say that VO starts interview by asking that what did you change in the application and why it was rejected last time. I don't have proper answers for both of these questions. 
Please give me your suggestions.  Thanks.

To the people getting rejected: I know it may seem like that you are rejected for no reason and many of you have posted sharing your concerns that you are rejected and have expressed your frustration too. So let me explain you the major reason. Before I explain you the reason let me tell you that I have received two F visas and one J visa with no travel history before my first visa. Currently I am doing my PhD. So one of the major reason is Finances.
Let’s be honest when you 
show bank statements, are you really going to be using those finances? And VO knows that! They know that the 70 lacs you are showing many of you don’t intend to use that money and just showing it to get the visa. After you get the visa, you will start thinking how you will pay for your education. So if you don’t have a full-ride or a loan, or a TA or RA ship you won’t be able to pay for your education. Don’t be misled thinking that you will be able to make sufficient money with an on-campus job, the on-campus job is only sufficient enough to pay for some of your expenses such as food, bills and sometimes rent. You can’t pay tuition and health insurance with a part time job and working full-time or working off-campus during semesters is ILLEGAL! Majority of you are rejected primarily because of your finances because your finance story doesn’t make sense. VO knows the cost of living in US, and cost of tuition, they are mentioned on your I-20. So they are well aware that you won’t be able to furnish this amount and the bank statement that you showed is probably just to show so you can get that visa. 
Yes, not getting the visa is disappointing. But it will be more disappointing once you get to US and can’t pay for your expenses. So again if you don’t have a full-ride, A TA/RA offer or majority tuition scholarship, don’t think that you will be able to manage the finances. 
Hope this helps and clears some doubts. Don’t blame the embassy or the system because if you are eligible for visa, you will get one but if you know deep down that “I am just showing these statements to get visa, I won’t be using this money” than know that VO knows this and you won’t get the visa. 
Best of luck!

I was rejected for this upcoming fall semester. 
To improve my application, I need to find a good ranked university.
The MS programs I am looking for are
Data science
Data analytics
Business Analytics
Computer science
Unfortunately my CGPA was 2.95. But I have a over 2 years of relevant work experience. Hence looking for names where i can get accepted with the CGPA and without mandatory GRE.
After my research many universities are saying that they might consider, but they usually don't. Had the same experience last term alot of money was wasted on application fees.
I will be very thankful if someone suggest me good universities with good rank for the spring semester.

Me : he married in pakistan about 4 years ago
Vo: *thinking*
Me:  your visa is rejected , ( failed to show ties to home country)
Anyways, didnt apply to US again after this and applied for canada through SDS and i got accepted.
If you dont get accepted in US in the first try, rather than begging them in 2nd or 3rd try for a visa , just change your country because some of us are not born with silver spoons in our mouth , nor have any businesses to show ties.

Well 
I won’t right down the conversation here unlike others. But i will say they are doing completely piece of shit out there. It’s a total crap. I invested more than 2 months in this whole process and all I had to bear was extremely reluctant behaviour at the counter. The VO was least interested in taking the interview and was all set to pass me the yellow slip.

Visa Rejection and Approvals (F-1) 
Dear community, 
I have received 3 F visas in the past with no rejections. I have noticed people sharing their profiles and asking why those that have gotten visas think they were rejected. So with that, please take my advice as it suits you. 
1) 
Are you a genuine student? 
You should ask this question to yourself because life in US is not what is shown in Hollywood movies. Life is very challenging there and you being a genuine student means not increasing more issues for yourself. You can’t just change statuses easily, you can’t just start working there, you can’t just marry there, all these who create this illusions in your mind are not truthful. If your intent is to not study than do not consider applying for F visas. 
2) Can you really pay for a university that’s not offering you any scholarship?
With how the economy is of Pakistan, VO knows real well whether you will be able to pay or not. Don’t think you can just work there and pay for Tuition, health insurance, food, rent, bills, and save. You can’t do that on a 20 hour job. Also, it’s hard in a lot of universities now to get jobs and you can’t work off campus, so plan very very carefully. Don’t get yourself in that mess where you are stuck! If you can’t pay for your Tuition don’t lie about it. If you know your parents won’t be able to pay don’t get yourself in a bad shape. It’s better to go a little later with a better financial package than trying to hurry and than being in bad shape.
3) Getting rejected and immediately running for the next appointment 
Mainly those of you that get rejected are getting rejected on showing weak ties. You can’t just suddenly improve your ties in a week. Don’t rush the situation. Give yourself time to see what went wrong, is it really the university or is it that it was pretty obvious during interview that you won’t be able to pay as you say you will be or you were caught in a lie. Don’t underestimate the ability of VO to know about the circumstances. They are really good at scanning people, that’s what they do all day everyday. So lying about a situation will only get you refusals. When you get refused don’t panic and run for the next available appointment. Try to see what you can change depending upon what went wrong in your interview. 
4) Stay away from consultants! 
Applying for US visa and universities is pretty easy. It’s getting a good financial package is what’s difficult. So stay away from consultants!! They mostly are there to drain your money! I got three F visas and never went to a consultant. 
5) keep faith in yourself 
I know it’s easier for me to say that. But, losing faith in yourself will only put you in worst shape than what you are in. Always know, there are tons of places around the world where you can go study. One country is not what will define your future. Always take a step back and try applying to other countries. You might be able to get a really good package somewhere else. So don’t drain yourself emotionally or mentally! 
I hope this helps those who have been rejected and those that will apply in near future

The curriculum should have a dedicated career track in business analytics with real time problem solving subjects like capstone and management internship and for these courses recently depaul university has launched beta lab. It’s a virtual platform for students to solve business problem by implementing real world data using different softwares such as SAP, Oracle Tableau and power BI. Also I’m particularly interested business intelligence and big data analysis and Don Pitchell who director of business analytics program is one the top researchers in the area. So If I would get a chance to work under him as a research assistant it would be greater opportunity for me. 
VO: okay… 
Me: yes Ma’m I have also done extensive research prior to applying at DePaul University. 
VO: ohh so you have contacted any students.
Me: yes Officer I have contact with current student and I found out that students can actually interact directly with professor rather than their TA, I mean what else do I need student right.
VO: How this will relate with you future goals? 
Me:I want to pursue career as a business analyst, which is the fastest growing field literally in every sector of Pakistan. as we’re still developing country and there is a huge market gap in Building tech industry. I will definitely get a good return out of the investment. 
But Officer… 
VO: yeah continue..
Me: My ultimate vision  is to get 3 to 4 years of experience and I will start up my own business consultancy firm. as you know business has been suffered alot in the pandemic and due to lack of disastrous management and modern analytical tools.
VO: is there any family member or other relative in USA. 
Me: No Officer there is no one in USA from my family.
VO: I can see you have been rejected before. 
Me: yes Officer I was nervous because it was my first visa interview and I couldn’t answer to questions that were asked to me and visa officer was not satisfied with my answers and this time I have changed the approach to explain my self.
 VO: have you considered any other country like Canada, UK and Pakistan. 
Me: No Ma’m haven’t considered Pakistan because there a few university that are currently offering Business analytics program and I would hardly get research opportunity and practical exposure. So I will definitely experience a good learning environment. 
VO: what about fundings?
Me: My father is sponsoring me he has savings of *** and *** immovable assists for my studies and part from this I have got 5000 dollar scholarship.
VO: So what does your sponsor do. 
Me: He is a business man and own a well established business.(interpreted) 
VO: what business??
Me: it’s actually Fertilizers distribution business (interpreted) 
VO: its the same business that you’re currently working. 
Me: yes Officer as a Business development Manager. Continue… and he is one few authored dealers of Engro incorporation which is the Pakistan’s number 1 fertilizer production company. And he has been doing this business since 11 years and he has over a dozen of employees and his annual income is ***. 
VO: I know you’re a genuine student and You really want to study in USA but unfortunately you’re not qualified for this time.
Me: Ma’m is there any specific reason. 
VO: No there is not any specific reason but But I’m giving you the slip and reason is mentioned in slip.
*Please guide me where I went wrong and should I go for 3rd attempt with same profile or I should differ my semester with same university or even I should change university in next intake*

Interview Advice for those who got rejected in first Attempt.
You may go with the same university but not with the same profile. VO will must ask you what circumstances have you change this time?
Circumstances mean ur academic, professional, financial or personal circumstances…University is not ur circumstance. 
Try to identify the reason of rejection, improve ur profile accordingly and then apply again with a gap of minimum one month for next attempt for same intake
Re-apply 
with no change in ur circumstances would be a waste of time and money.

Me: Data Sciences.

All the time she was interrupted by another lady officer which engaged her in talks, and she was going inside again and again and while asking questions she was writing in her screen,  in whole interview she was in a very good mood and was very casual. I've thought that she'll give me the visa.

Interview 19th May 2023 
Rejected 
University of arizona 
Bacholars
Please everyone read it and let me know what can I improve in next interview and what were my mistakes because my classes will Start soon and I can't delay them, I already had a gap year.
Vo:show me your documents
Me: passed them
Vo: financial statement 
Me: passed them
Vo: this is just a bunch of papers
( I didn't knew what to answer about it, like I can not bring money here obviously it have to be on paper) whatever
Me: explained that this is my mother's account and it has money generated from her school/collage.
Vo: which school
Me: named the school
(It's a local school)
Vo: started typing the name of school on computer, maybe he was searching about the school.
Vo: which university 
Me: university of Arizona 
Vo: how did you got to know about it?
Me: searched about good ranking universities and so
Vo: what will you study 
Me: software engineering 
Now here I am a little confused, I can not remember what he asked for, maybe my future plan or maybe why I want to study software engineering.
Me: I proceeded to explain him that I what to convert my mother's school and collage in IT University, as all great university are in lahore  islamabad and karachi, for computer and faislabad is deprived of great universities, so students have to migrate from there to other cities which everyone can not afford. And many parents don't allow and students also have safety problem.
Vo: that's more than enough
(The reality is that, EVERYTHING I SAID HERE WAS A LIE, I DONT WANT TO PROCEED WITH THE UNIVERSITY, I WANT TO OPEN A SOFTWARE HOUSE IN PAKISTAN, but I thought that he might not be convinced with software house as it can be opened anywhere and not necessarily in pakistan, so lied about the university. I think this was kind of biggest mistake, as the person before me gave the same kind of Statement 
Like good country man, help my nation, help my brother, help My country, blah blah, something like this, so my statement also seems kind of fake created, that I want to help people of my city.)
Proceeding
Vo: any relatives there
Me: no
Vo: have you been there before
Me: no
Vo: siblings 
Me: one is AS and second one in 7th class
Vo: father
Me: banker in ...... bank 
Me added we have rental home from where get rent.
(This was not true but i had to justify the bank statement soo) 
Vo: how many
Me: 4
That's what I remember, 
Then he took some time, disappear to side or somewhere, then proceeded to give the yellow paper, 
The paper said that I could not establish ties with my country, and I am not proving that I will return.
Now things I am planning to change. 
1. Tell them the real aim, of building software house
2. Take my ntn, proof which shows that there is a school which is on my mother's name.
What else should I improve, please share your valuable views.

Guide: How to get an Emergency visa appointment for F1 visa category.
I had been very anxious over the past week as my interview appointment date was 4 days after my classes start date (on i20). 
I mailed my university asking for late arrival letter, but they rejected my request and instead sent me a letter (addressed to the embassy), asking the embessy to provide me with expedited visa interview and why it was of importance that I get an early appointment.
At first I was disappointed because there was no category for F1 visa seekers to apply for emergency, but I selected ""business"" from the dropdown menu and provided a brief explanation as to why it was important for me to get an early appointment. I uploaded my i20, letter recevied from university, and the current interview confirmation pdf.
I sent this request on friday night (29th July) and got response back on monday morning (31st July), with slots being available for this very current week!!
I have now rescheduled my interview in this week and hope my experience helps some of you guys/gals in the same boat as I was last week.
In the end all I have to say is that have faith in Allah, and pray. There is not much that you can control in this situation so just try your best and stay positive in any case.
PS: In case you found this post helpful, please remember me in your prayers as I will be appearing for interview in a couple days. Also I request you to kindly not ask me to dm unless absolutely necessary and ask questions in the comments as it will benefit others down the road too. I saw so many dead posts regarding this topic so I finally decided to make one (I almost didn't even apply for emergency appointment because I thought there was no point in doing it).
PS2: Everything above is just based on my own personal experience and I am in no way an expert in this matter.

Should I select the visa refused category when searching for dates, or the other one?

Hello guys, I had my visa interview yesterday and it got rejected. During the interview the VO asked me about my bank statement, i showed it to her and then she goes where did all these funds come from? I replied that my father transfered all the funds from our family saving account to this account to carry out my university expenses? She said do you have the statement for the family savings account, I didn’t had it with me that time and after two three questions she rejected 
my visa. also note my father opened this account in December 2022 , do you think this could be the reason for rejection?

Me: bcz my father suggested me to go to usa bcz he wants to expand his business to other cities like abc city and also if add more reasons, usa education system focuses on critical thinking, discussions and practical skills while pakistani education system just has traditional exam oriented approach 
Vo: ok ok alright (stopped me speaking)
Vo: what was your business? Clothing business?
Me: no it was bakery items ( even i had already told him in heavy details that’s it’s food business)
Vo: oh like cakess
Me: yes
Vo: sorry I can’t issue you a visa at this time policies are strict. 
Me: (still a slight smile) thankyou 
…
I wasn’t so confident during interview but I wasn’t also below average, confidence was average. My fluency was like 7/10. But I didn’t looked scared besides I was, i made it look cool with a very little smile after i ended answering.
He didn’t asked about my usa university didn’t even name of the uni
Didn’t asked who is sponsoring me, just asked father’s business 
He was just straight to point I don’t know why he was so suspicious even i had every document real.
He was a very very long beard guy in his 30’s 
This post is not to “discourage” i know something was wrong with my case or my visa interview.
Experts what could be the red flag that got me rejected?

Hello guys today i had my interview
Visa : approved
Literally no question was asked I just went there greeted her. No document was checked and asked for. The VO was a lady who herself was from penn state and joked with me that penn state has the best ice cream and then she approved my visa.
Edit: people are saying that how lucky Iam, but that is not the case. I already had a very strong case and had no reason to be rejected. I was already a B1/B2 visit visa holder. I had visited USA 4 times and always returned showing I had strong ties to my country and most of all I had an outstanding university (you can check). The VO also being from penn state acted as a cherry on top.

Assalam-o-Alaikum all I'm in need of your assistance. My visa application has been rejected twice at the Islamabad Embassy, despite receiving a generous scholarship offer from the university. My challenge lies in the fact that I have already completed my Master's degree. Whenever I attend the interview, the first question I am asked is why I wish to pursue a second Master's degree, and this is where my visa application gets denied. Therefore, I kindly request your guidance on 
how to secure admission for a Ph.D. program. My academic background includes an MSCS (Data Science) degree with 3.37/4.00 cgpa with research , and I am looking for an economically viable option with available scholarships and a streamlined application process. Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

My F1 was rejected in October on 214b and i have reapplied for December.
I have changed my sponsor. Initially I was the only sponsor and now i have shown my father as the main sponsor, i also got 5000 USD scholarship from university and around 9000 USD i am showing as a community loan which i will be taking after visa approval.
How do I answer the question about why i have changed so much in my finances in just 2 month time as initially i said i have the required funds to cover 
my complete education and now I have showing a loan and my father as sponser.
Need advise how to answer this!

It’s going pretty good. Pass me your documents .

Vo: Okay ! How many universities you’ve applied ?
Me: I applied to 5 universities in 5 different states !
Vo: can you name them !
Told !!
Vo: Why this university ?
Me: I have various reasons but mainly because of my dean, Mr. scott beaulier he is PHD from George Mason university and have more than 10 years of professional experience and i believe i can learn alot under his supervision moreover the overall faculty was very helpful and cooperative.
Vo: Do you have someone in the states?
Me: Yes my brother is there !
Then he asked me questions about him and his face expression totally changed after he came to know my brother is there !!
I know that is why my visa is refused.
But overall it was really a bad day at embassy , I have seen only two girls getting blue slips otherwise it felt like a yellow day at embassy!
I was pretty much confident and was not nervous.
If anyone else got a visa today please share the experience and Congratulations to those two girls 
Good Luck to those who have interviews scheduled in next days :))

Looking for the genuine help! 
I've been rejected twice in the F1 Visa interview at Karachi Consulate (1st by Chinese VO, 2nd by 1st counter American with slightly bald personality).
I have 100% scholarship from the university for my masters. I've applied to only one school though. 
Should I apply for the third time with the same profile or leave it?
I'm just concerned that I don't want to change my university, but what should I say when the VO will ask ""What Circumstances Have You Changed This Time?"".
"

Embassy: Islamabad 
Status: rejected
VO: Good morning
Me: Good morning 
VO: 
(after passing documents and after scanning fingers) why are you going to US
Me: I'm going to study masters in computer science from Maharishi international university
VO: Why this university
Me: I have chosen this university because it's offering the courses that I was looking for. I'm working as a consultant and I have to get expertise in (mentioned 4 subjects). These fields are very important for my consultancy position and MIU is offering courses related to all these subjects.
VO: Do you have any travel history
Me: No sir
VO: Who's sponsoring you
Me: My sister
VO: I can't give you visa, reason is mentioned on this slip.
Question1: What could be the possible reason for rejection? 
Question2: I applied for November intake. Should I try again or wait for February intake?
Question 3: should I add my current employer as my sponsor (they are willing to sponsor me). Would that be a plus? I'm afraid it will make my case suspicious that why your company wasn't sponsoring you before.
