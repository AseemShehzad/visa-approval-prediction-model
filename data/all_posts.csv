Hello,
I was refused for F1 Visa twice last year. I am currently a second-year bachelor's student. I have received an invitation from Harvard to attend their event. Is there anyone in the group who can help me strengthen my case and make it more convincing for the visa officer when applying for the B1 visa?

Q1, 
What are the courses you’re going to study in first semester?
Ans, Cornerstone and two introductory courses. Fundamentals of management & marketing.

Ans, After graduation last year, I joined the xyz industry and I noticed a commonality amongst CEOs of top 10 companies operating here which was that 7 out 10 CEOs have all studied from the USA. And since I also want to make my career in Pakistani xyz industry, having studied in the US would increase my odds of a successful career in Pakistan Significantly.
Q2, When did you graduate? 
Ans, Last year in 2022, in the months on June/July

Q7, (Pointing towards to amount on I20) VO asked about how I’ll arrange the funds needed for the second year of my master’s as the amount written on i20 is only for 1st year.
Ans, I already have the funds needed for second year of my masters as can be seen from my bank statements. My family has liquid funds of double the amount needed in I20 allowing for any unforeseen circumstances.
Q8, Please show me your bank statements
Ans, Passed the statements to the VO
Kept looking on the screen and then said that the US visa laws are very strict I’m sorry and then gave me a white slip.

Visa Approved in the third attempt!
Sharing this experience as a hope for many of you guys who will be appearing in their third attempt. I was refused twice in May and June from Islamabad Consulate. I applied again with the same profile after deferring my admission in the Karachi Consulate. 
I was refused first time around for showing myself self sponsoring my education even though I wasn't doing any job and my father had given me the funds back then too. It was a blunder from 
my side in the first attempt. 
2nd time around, the interview lasted only a minute, before visa officer refused me without asking any major questions. It was quite tough to gather the confidence for applying again after such an interview. 
Interview on 26th October.
University of Houston.
Master's in Industrial Engineering.
Karachi Consulate. 
Visa officer was an American Male in his 40's. 
When I reached the counter, we greeted each other and after that there was a pause of around 2-3 minutes without Vo asking me anything as he was going through my profile. 
Vo: Tell me about your parents.
My mother is a housewife. My father is an industrialist, we have have a business of manufacturing of adhesives and lubricants which my grandfather started 50 years back and after him his sons are managing it now and also the reason why I want to do industrial engineering, as I have to comeback and manage it afterwards.
Vo: In how many uni's did you apply?
I applied to a total of 5 uni's, out of which I got accepted into 4 of them. I applied to Clemson University where I got rejected from, and I got acceptances from UIC, USF, FSU and UOH where I'm going. Among them I choose University of Houston because Houston is a big industrial city and UOH has strongly industrial affiliated faculty. There are couple of professors at UOH, who take their students for industrial visits every week as part of their curriculum which enhance their practical knowledge which I'm looking for. 
I was quite animated at this moment and was making some hand gestures which annoyed the Vo. He asked me to stop doing that and answer him as I was talking to a friend. 
Vo: So you have one brother who is handling your family business? (I don't know where he got this from)
I told him that I have two elders brothers and they are also handling the business and well.
Vo: Have your brothers also studied from aboard?
No. They have got their education in Pakistan. 
Vo: Why do they want to send you abroad?
Told the visa officer how many brothers always wanted me to get the exposure and how they have always encouraged me to pursue education from abroad. I did an Aiesec internship in 2019, mentioned that too.
After this the Vo stopped asking questions and tried to make a decision but he was undecided at this time. I asked him I could help him with anything else but he said that he is not sure either way right now. I asked him should I tell him about why choose Industrial Engineering in the first place. He said no and that I would have read the website and would just pour it all out on him. 
I said no, just let me explain why I wanted to do Industrial Engineering.
Told him about Industrial Engineering and how USA is the pioneer of this field and that only a couple of uni's in germany and canada are offering this course with the same curriculum. Also mentioned that I have acceptances from Canada and Australia as well but I choose USA because of their quality etc.
Vo: Did your Visa also got rejected from Canada and Australia?
No. I didn't apply for Visa there, as I wanted to study Industrial Eng and my courses were different there.
Vo was still undecided trying to make a decision.
Vo: How big is your industry.
Told him about the number of people working there.
Vo: Okay, tell me about your time at Turkey.
Told him about Aiesec and how this internship gave me exposure and boosted my confidence etc. 
Eventually, the Vo handed me the blue slip. 
Vo: Enjoy your time in the USA.

Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world.

They also offer practicle courses, flexible education and cultural diversity further enhanced the educational experience. 
Vo. what are you going to study

vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.

This time, i have did everything on my own and i have received my i-20 and i want to take an Embassy appointment. I asked the consulatant can you just take an appointment for me, he is saying “I am Busy, i’ll do it when i have time”.  And he also isn’t giving me the credentials of the portal. 
Can you please let me know, for taking an embassy appointment, as i am in a refused 
category, do i need to use the same account of US Embassy portal by which my DS-160 was submitted earlier and i took my appointment?

VO: 
Hay Good Morning
Me: Good Morning
VO: Pass me your passport and I-20
Me: Sure Sir
VO: Put your right hand 4 finger on the scanner
Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

Me: Sir ,Is their anything wrong in my profile or what is the actual reason of refusal so that I can workout on it

Me: 3, UC Berkeley , Caltech and UT Austin.
VO: Ahn ,did you get admit from them ?
Me: UC Berkeley No ( because I was looking for fully funded offer ) ,UT Austin Yes with fully funded offer.
VO: Why Caltech ?
Me: There is number of reasons behind it 1) Pre-communication with my PhD supervisor, 2) Lab facilities in Caltech are advanced; 3) First university which are offering courses in 3D printing.
VO: why you look for 3D printing courses ?
Me: Because I'll be conducting my research with my supervisor on 3D print Concrete structures.

Me: Kind of , well sir actually I don't see any scope of 3DPC in my home country in next 20-25 years ,as this is highly advanced and emerging construction technology ,we still rely on traditional formwork construction, therefore , honestly speaking I'll be looking for a job in US or in Australia after having my PhD from Caltech in 3DPC .And...( VO asked ) .
VO: I see, this has to be an emerging and advance technology.You motivated me to study about it.chuckle..He called another guy on his back side and started discussing something while looking at my CV and I-20 .They were taking time ....
VO:Any travel history?
Me: Yes , Singapore, Japan , Turkey, UAE, Thailand and Malaysia etc.

Me: should I change my university for the 2nd attempt.
VO: it's not necessary, Caltech is best.
I was wondering and tried to get more Infos from there but couldn't succeed .
I still have the feelings that ties with country in this shouldn't be the case of visa  rejection.

READ THIS COMPLETELY IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO WASTE YOUR $$$ AND BE TRAPPED BY THESE SO-CALLED CONSULTANTS
All this started back in October 2022.
Firstly, I decided to go USA for my further studies as an undergraduate student, I chose my desired university but as I was blank and didn't know about this group I got trapped by one of the consultants in Karachi
OceanMall Those who live in Karachi know about it, There's a similar agency by the name of Ocean. I went there and discussed my university they told me they are associated with them but later on they got back to their word when I paid out their upfront fee and they forced me to their Panel Unversities
After paying out 40k PKR upfront they shared with me a document that says you need to pay a further 600$ to us for your process which indicates that 2/3 University application fee, SOP, Motivation letter, Internal evaluation of your documents US standards, and attestation from notary public
When I asked about my desired university all their excuse was that I was being so specific about it, and when I paid them and asked them to add one more university in place of my desired uni they acknowledged me we would do it
So, when I 1st paid them 300$ half of the 600$ which was equivalent to 67k PKR back on that date they provided me a single admission letter by the end of Dec 2022, and when I inquired about my money where they spent they refused to keep the transparency with me about anything and further added that when we get the admission letter our job is done, we don't apply to more university until we need. 
when I told them I needed the admission letter from the remaining uni as well I was told this would take 1 or 2 months which I answered I had no issues with that I needed it yet after 1 month they asked me to send my English test to uni that's where I got to know all that time they have not done anything and when I inquired about the last one which they answered ""we are not getting replies by that uni"" when I was personally in touch with that uni I was shocked and utterly disappointed to see that lying wasn't a big deal for them
That's where I wasted my 5 months because of them
Secondly, When I was doing everything on my own I got an acceptance letter and I20 from the university but then again I got trapped by another consultant this time got to learn about that agents who work with different recruiters, and all directly don't apply directly but by through the channels
I got the offer letter from Texas A&M Corpus Christi and the agency asked me to pay the Initial enrollment fee which was $ 1,000 I paid that fee in May 2023 and now I'm chasing them to get my refund back
When I paid out the enrollment fee I was just waiting for the I20, but guess what I have been offered an admission letter but my documents were not submitted still to the university that is again I got to know by the University itself after 2.5 months and the intake also missed out
So now altogether my 4 Lac 6k PKR is stucked with these consultants
Right now at the start of October, I tried to trust another person who was vouched by my friend to take my case and started working on but the person has disappeared now for no reason this time I have not paid anything to that person but, my time YES
My main reason for sharing this experience with you all is that do your research and apply on your own these consultants and recruiters will just gonna waste your time and nothing else
They know how to trap the students by showing scholarship ads and all but in the end they will offer you the same thing which you can find on the university website
This group has everything that a student needs!!!!

Me: I don't know. Maybe i loose my confidence or due to bad circumstances.
VO: But you had to clearify from the last Visa officer that why she's refusing your Visa?
.......I was really confused at this question and didn't know what to answer.......
Than I simply replied that you (V officers) don't tell the actual reason to the candidates.
She started typing on computer and i still had a Hope that I've given my best full confidently so after typing she just gonna approve my Visa but when she put yellow slip in front of me than I was really shocked.

Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Good afternoon everybody!
I was refused in April 2023 (F1 Visa).
Now I have changed my university and would like to appear for the interview again.
Unfortunately, I am not able to secure the date before 21st August 2023.
I 
booked the appointment in 1st week of September, I then talked to my university's International department in this regard and they were more than happy to provide me late arrival approval letter in case of attending the orientation and classes online on the zoom.
I consented and they provided me the late arrival approval letter of 1 month (20/09/2023).
Now I want to know if I could not secure the early dates, would I be able to satisfy my Consular officer with that letter?
Anyone with the same experience got their visa approved?
Please step forward and help me in this regard, I would be more than grateful to get assisted.
Thanks and Jazak Allah.

Visa refused (weak ties to home country)
Responses:
Why this university 
There are a couple of reasons for choosing this uni, it is offering me modules like international political economy that no other college in my list offered which directly aligns with my future plans. 
Other than that its location was a major attraction for me, as depaul is in center of Chicago, chicago is very diversified hence I can gain alot of cultural exposure which will further bolster my education.
Lastly, it gave me a generous amount of scholarship
Who is sponsoring you?
My father, what does he do(told)
How many employees in his company?
25-30 
What other schools did you apply to?
I applied top liberal arts schools in uk&usa.
Why did you choose this uni over them?
It had a better sub courses, and offered me more scholarship. 
Can anyone tell me where did I go wrong?

He was insisting that I must have to tell him that where university got funding to give me salary. He said your visa is refused and asked me to send him documents for further administration procedure. He said we will send you email then you can send us your passport by post later.

Hi everyone 
On 4th April my f1 visa was refused in US embassy but now I got another appointment for 3rd August 
I need help in one of my question for interview. 
I have applied at Illinois State University for nutrition psychology 
Need help to upgrade and arrange my answer of this question.
Q- 
Why USA? 
A- 
 Well, as everyone knows US ranks at no . 1 for having best education system and new research methods.Illinois State University is also providing American certified degrees which will help me to establish my career here more successful as there are not many experts in this field in my country and we need them.. According to Education Quality and Technology, America is far better than any other country because Germany is also offering research based studies and my field is all about research and survey based in which I’m interested but because of language barrier I can not express  myself there but in US it will be easier for me to communicate and learn.I also had a choice for UK but in UK There’s no multicultural environment.

Visa Approved in the third attempt!
Sharing this experience as a hope for many of you guys who will be appearing in their third attempt. I was refused twice in May and June from Islamabad Consulate. I applied again with the same profile after deferring my admission in the Karachi Consulate. 
I was refused first time around for showing myself self sponsoring my education even though I wasn't doing any job and my father had given me the funds back then too. It was a blunder from 
my side in the first attempt. 
2nd time around, the interview lasted only a minute, before visa officer refused me without asking any major questions. It was quite tough to gather the confidence for applying again after such an interview. 
Interview on 26th October.
University of Houston.
Master's in Industrial Engineering.
Karachi Consulate. 
Visa officer was an American Male in his 40's. 
When I reached the counter, we greeted each other and after that there was a pause of around 2-3 minutes without Vo asking me anything as he was going through my profile. 
Vo: Tell me about your parents.
My mother is a housewife. My father is an industrialist, we have have a business of manufacturing of adhesives and lubricants which my grandfather started 50 years back and after him his sons are managing it now and also the reason why I want to do industrial engineering, as I have to comeback and manage it afterwards.
Vo: In how many uni's did you apply?
I applied to a total of 5 uni's, out of which I got accepted into 4 of them. I applied to Clemson University where I got rejected from, and I got acceptances from UIC, USF, FSU and UOH where I'm going. Among them I choose University of Houston because Houston is a big industrial city and UOH has strongly industrial affiliated faculty. There are couple of professors at UOH, who take their students for industrial visits every week as part of their curriculum which enhance their practical knowledge which I'm looking for. 
I was quite animated at this moment and was making some hand gestures which annoyed the Vo. He asked me to stop doing that and answer him as I was talking to a friend. 
Vo: So you have one brother who is handling your family business? (I don't know where he got this from)
I told him that I have two elders brothers and they are also handling the business and well.
Vo: Have your brothers also studied from aboard?
No. They have got their education in Pakistan. 
Vo: Why do they want to send you abroad?
Told the visa officer how many brothers always wanted me to get the exposure and how they have always encouraged me to pursue education from abroad. I did an Aiesec internship in 2019, mentioned that too.
After this the Vo stopped asking questions and tried to make a decision but he was undecided at this time. I asked him I could help him with anything else but he said that he is not sure either way right now. I asked him should I tell him about why choose Industrial Engineering in the first place. He said no and that I would have read the website and would just pour it all out on him. 
I said no, just let me explain why I wanted to do Industrial Engineering.
Told him about Industrial Engineering and how USA is the pioneer of this field and that only a couple of uni's in germany and canada are offering this course with the same curriculum. Also mentioned that I have acceptances from Canada and Australia as well but I choose USA because of their quality etc.
Vo: Did your Visa also got rejected from Canada and Australia?
No. I didn't apply for Visa there, as I wanted to study Industrial Eng and my courses were different there.
Vo was still undecided trying to make a decision.
Vo: How big is your industry.
Told him about the number of people working there.
Vo: Okay, tell me about your time at Turkey.
Told him about Aiesec and how this internship gave me exposure and boosted my confidence etc. 
Eventually, the Vo handed me the blue slip. 
Vo: Enjoy your time in the USA.

Please Admin approve my post.
AOA to all of you.
I've been accepted by a professor for PhD program at the University of California, USA. I need your feedback on an important matter. The guidelines state that if you've studied in an English medium, you don't need an English test like IELTS or TOEFL. I reached out to the professor, who advised me to ask the graduate admission director, but I haven't received a response. I then contacted the graduate student affairs officer, who 
confirmed that I don't need to take the IELTS.
I'm a bit concerned about whether I should proceed without the test. The application deadline is December 1st, and need a 7-band score. Will this decision impact my application negatively? Your insights are much appreciated.

The atmosphere was very comfortable, and seeing that made my confidence boost. I spoke with the Visa Officer in a friendly manner, as if I was having a conversation with a friend. I had prepared long answers, but during the interview, I only spoke when necessary and avoided giving unnecessary details.
I want to tell all of you that feeling nervous is valid. It's okay to be nervous, and that's completely normal. Just don't stress out. I can't express how nervous and stressed I was, but once I was there, the environment made it easy, and I was able to manage my nervousness. One more important thing: hold on tightly to your faith in ALLAH. Our success is not because of our efforts alone, it's by the will of Allah. Get close to Him and put your trust in Him. Pray Tahajjud and Nawafil, and have faith in every aspect of your journey. They really helped me stay relaxed.
Additionally, this group also played a significant role in helping me. If your DS-160 form is filled out correctly, you have all the required tests and documents, then you're on the right track to get your visa.

Semester: Spring '24
Consulate: Karachi
Date: 21-08-23
VO 
was a middle-aged white man.
VO: Hi!
Me: Hello! good morning.
VO: Pass me these documents (I had my passport, I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation in my hand)
Me: Sure. There you go.
VO: (After looking at my documents) How old are you?
Me: I'm 23 years old.
VO: (After some time) so you are going to do your masters? 
Me: Yes sir!
VO: How did you get to know about this university?
Me: I came to know about SIUE from my FYP advisor. He has done researches and have publications in clean energy technologies. He has high regards for the work done by Dr. XYZ, he is a professor in the mechanical department of SIUE. Further upon my research I got to know that it is a notable institute in the Midwestern region. I also found the Uni to be affordable and upon completion of my admission process, I also recieved a scholarship of $8,000, which helped me finalising my decision to choose SIUE.
(VO hardly maintained any eye contact all this time)
VO: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Me: I have one younger brother.
VO: What do your parents do?
Me: My mother is a teacher at XYZ school and my father is a government employee in the ministry of XYZ as an Assistant Officer.
(He got a little confused at assistant officer, I had to tell him again and also mentioned my father's grade to him)
For a minute or so he kept typing something on his computer. And after a minute gave me my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation back.
At this point I was thinking that he didn't give me my passport back to me but then I saw him taking out a blue slip and eventually kept my mouth shut 
VO: There you go. (Not even a congratulations 
)
Me: Thank you. When can I have my passport back?
VO: You will receive an email in a week or so.
Me: Alright. Have a nice day. 
He only asked me 4 questions out of which I guess only 2 were relevant to my interview. He didn't ask for any single document other than my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation. I stayed confident, and maintained my tone but all of that wasn't even looked at 
. He already refused 2 F-1 candidates right infront of me and I was really scared but Alhumdulillah everything went far better than I expected. 
My question now is, how long will it take to get my passport back and when does the visa status on the portal gets updated??
Any questions are welcomed.

INTERVIEWER: INFAMOUS ASIAN
NO GRE
NO IELTS
GPA 2.86
Date: 8th June.
DISCLAIMER: My interview was very different from others so please don't take it as a guide as I don't want to mislead anyone.
After preparing myself for straight 20 days I went for an Interview, I was prepared for every kind of question, but there was something else written in my fate.
VO DID NOT ASK ANY COMMON QUESTIONS LIKE:
Why US? 
Why this university?
Rather he started like this
1) what are your daily responsibilities in your current job?
2) what does your father do? (Convinced with my one word ANSWER)
3) what are your plans after graduation? (Told him the names of 3 it companies name where I'm aiming to work at)
4) do you have any relatives? I said yes because I didn't want to lie
5) will you leave the current job? I said yes (btw I just joined that job 20 days ago)
Conclusion: All that time he was behaving as if the decision is already decided because he seemed too uninterested to hear my answers. It was like as if he was just completing a formality nothing else.
In a nutshell, for me US F1 VISA IS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON LUCK BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A HEC FUNDED PHD LEVEL GUY GETTING REJECTED WHOSE PROFILE WAS 4X STRONGER THAN MINE.
BUT GO WELL PREPARED AND BE CONFIDENT. I ALSO GREETED HIM IN A VERY LOUD VOICE. Also don't forget to pray and take your mother's prayers as they can do wonders.
GOODLUCK!
Thankyou

1st Attempt: Approved Alhumdulillah.
Interview was at 25th May Karachi Consulate.
Profile: BS from LUMS, going for MS Finance at University of Houston. Had Received out-of-station tuition waiver and additional scholarship as well. Have been working at Multinational bank for almost two years now.
VO: 
Pass me your passport and F1.
VO:  Why university of Houston?
ME: Firstly, the courses which they are offering, related to derivates trading and hedging and this is where my professional experience lies, as I have been working in the banking industry for over 2 years now, and I feel this degree would help me fill in the gaps in my skill set.
Also, one of my university professors had recommended this course and degree, as he had also completed his master’s from there.
Also, I have been following Professor XYZ, throughout my undergraduate phase, and read his publications on hedging techniques, so I thought it would be quite an experience to take live lectures from him.
VO: interesting!
VO: What is your job ?
ME: Told him about the general job description, routine tasks etc.
VO: Plans after graduation.
ME: Obviously, the plan is to complete my master’s with good GPA. And then to focus on my banking career, as employers in the Pakistani banking sectors tend to value those profiles and individuals who have done their education specifically from US Colleges. In fact, my current supervisor had done his Master’s from abroad, and at a very young age he is doing quite well. I have a similar objective, I believe this degree would help me to excel in the Pakistan banking sector, also that I have made good repo with my supervisor, he would be willing to hire me at a senior position, once I complete my master’s.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME:  it is my father.
VO: What is his profession?
ME: He is a banker as well, and currently working in one of the banks in UAE.
VO: Pass me the statement.
I handed over the statement to him.
VO: Your credentials are good, I am approving your visa. You will get your passport in a week.
For all the aspirants out here, the only thing matters is your level of confidence and communication skills. Regardless of the circumstances, and whatever is the outcome, just give your 100% and maintain eye-contact.

Embassy: Islamabad
Date: 12 May
Visa Status: Approved
I was a bit nervous and none of my answers went 100% smooth.
Here's how interview went.
VO: Hello(in very friendly tone)
Me: Hi
VO: (After taking my docs and entering them on PC) Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going to attend Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Cincinnati.
VO: (After a pause) Why did you choose this University?
Me: (I stuttered during this answer a bit) I am going because this university is aligned with my research interest.
VO: Why did you choose University of Cincinnati specifically?
Me: Because the lab facilities and faculty is suited to my research in additive manufacturing. It's the same research that I did in my bachelor's. (stuttered here too)
VO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father. (I stopped after saying this for around 20 secs and then started speaking again) He is manager at X and makes Y money through job Z money through rentals and some money thru real estate trading which I don't know how much is.
VO: Cograts. Enjoy your stay at united states.
Me: Thanks.
Thoughts? 
The visa doesn't mostly depend on the interview. The VO wasn't even listening to me with attention. It depends on your uni, course and any funding you have(I had $20k scholarship). My interview wasn't the best. Actually, I would say it was average or below average.
Almost all visas(5/5) got approved before me. Only 2 were refused, who went after me. Those 2 had genuine reasons to refuse. If I were VO, I would even refuse them(not cuz of hate lol but their case didn't seem strong on paper)
Suggestions?
1. Don't go for consultants. They apply for you at few unis which VOs are aware of. VOs don't even consider you in that case. They straight away reject you.
2. Take IELTS. Take GRE. Secure full/partial scholarship(you can easily get it). Then go for visa. You will get it InshAllah.

Visa experience:
Hi! I want to share my visa experience with you all. Although I just recently joined this group like a week ago but still it had a great impact on my preparation. Hence, I’m here to show my gratitude.
My interview was quite long and VO asked me back to back questions.
Date: 28th April 2023
Interview duration: Almost 5-6 mins
Status: Approved
(Literally he rejected back to back four F1 visa students before me)
Me: Good Morning Sir!
VO: Hi just a moment! 
Me: Sure take your time
VO: Staring at the screen and typing something
Me: I kept on standing quietly for a minute
VO: Please hand me your documents
Me: Here you go!
VO: So you’re going to US for studying?
Me: Yes! I’m going to US to do my Master’s in Biotechnology from UTSA
VO: How exactly did you hear about this university? 
Me: Okay so there’s an interesting take to it, when I was in my final year doing my research, I mainly cited Professor Clyde Phelix’s publications and research articles for my thesis. I even asked for his help when I was stuck at one point in my research, and he was of such great help through emails. It is now my dream to work in his lab and have him as my supervisor and continue my research.
VO: What research did you do?
Me: I explained him about my FYP in 3-4 lines
VO: Hmm sounds interesting! So do you have any relatives in US?
Me: No sir I don’t have any immediate relatives however, my father’s distant cousin lives in Maryland I think .. I ‘m not sure.
VO: Slightly laughed and said well but you’re going to Texas!
Me: Smiled in a shy manner and nodded yes
VO: So you’re gonna live in campus dorm?
Me: Oh yes absolutely! I really want to fully absorb the campus culture and experience the dorm life. 
VO: So you’ve done bachelors from here?
Me: Yes sir! I have done my bachelor’s in biological sciences from _____ university and my major was immunology
VO: When did you graduate?
Me: I recently graduated in February 2023. 
VO: The entire time he was looking at his screen and hardly maintained eye contact
Me: I actually graduated Summa cum Laude in my batch
VO: Still staring at the screen, and said so who’s funding you?
Me: So my father is sponsoring my education and living expenses
VO: What does he do?
Me: My dad is a businessman affiliated with the real estate. He owns a construction company. He’s constructing a commercial plaza and alongside he constructs houses and sells them.
VO: How many siblings do you have?
Me: I just have one younger brother and he’s nine years younger than I am.
VO: Kept typing vigorously and staring the screen.
Me: I do have bank statement and my transcripts with me in case you want to see?
VO: Yeah okay sure I’ll check It anyway.
Me: Hands him the documents
VO: Did you give any standardized tests?
Me: Yes sir I gave IELTS only, because GRE was waived off but I was fully prepared and actually intended to give it though! 
***Okay so now he did something weird and I was like what’s he doing***
VO: He raised my transcripts, bank statement and other documents in the air and turned around to show the documents to 3-4 people sitting behind him. 
Me: I kept standing quietly and kept observing
VO: He kept typing for about 2-3 mins! Those 3 minutes felt like 10 mins I swear
Me: Silently praying in my heart to Lord that pleaseeee after this much lengthy interview please just save me the hassle and give the blue approval slip to me already.
***After 3 mins he hands me back my i-20 and seriously says***
VO: Make sure to show this at the airport
Me: I understood his hint but waited for his approval
VO: Congratulations I’m approving your visa! Good luck with your research make sure you do come up with an innovative way to tackle your research problem. Best of luck for your future and do remember to collect your passport on time
Me: I passed a smile! Said my thanks to him and left.
Sorry for the long narration 
 it had to be done! Once again I’d like to thank this group for providing a platform and for helping me in my journey.

These questions are so simple but in a way its more difficult for those students who are feeling hesitation in front of visa officer.

Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

F1 Visa Interview Experience, 26th September 
Karachi Embassy  
1st Attempt, Approved and Issued 
Illinois Institute of Technology, LLM Spring semester 2024.
It 
was a smooth process from start to finish.
Vo: Good Morning, pass me your documents.
Me: Good morning, here.
Vo: Why you are going to the USA?
Me: I am going for my master's LLM from IIT.
Vo: How many universities you have applied to?
Me: I applied to 4 universities and got accepted to 3 of them with 25-50% scholarships, and one of them hasn't gotten back to me yet.
Vo: So you are going for a master's in science? (I think this was a trick to confuse me).
Me: No, I'm going for my master's in law since I did my undergrad in law.
Vo: When and where did you get your undergrad degree?
Me: From the University of London in 2021
Vo: Why don't you have a UK student visa stamp on your passport?
Me: I did my LLB via an affiliated institute in Karachi.
(During this time, she was checking my passport).
Vo: Have you ever traveled abroad?
Me: Yes, I've been to the UK and Saudi Arabia 
Vo: You got a scholarship and these are your family funds, right? (Pointing at my I20)
Me: Yes, (My total funds were more than the expenses listed on the I20).
Vo: OK, who is going to sponsor you?
Me: My father will be sponsoring me and explained all the details. 
Vo: Does your father have a visa?
Me: Yes, 
(I thought she was talking about the UK visa at this point, but she was asking about the US visa. Corrected myself and told her No).
Vo: What are your future plans?
Me: My plan is to come back and start my own practice here in international law. 
Vo: OK, I am approving your visa. You’ll get your passport within a week and here’s the slip.
These are a few tips I learned from my whole experience.
- Do your paperwork from filing your ds160 to the interview appointment. I made a slight mistake in my ds160 and changed my form before the interview. 
- Be confident during the interview, it matters a lot. They scrutinize the body language and attitude of the applicant. 
- If you're not sure, ask around in the group. I posted many times with my queries and asked members for help.
- Reach out to the universities repeatedly for your concerns, they’ll help you in every way possible.
- Watch Argo Visa Interviews, they are so helpful and accurate. 
- Take this interview as a normal interview. It’s a normal process. Usually I overthink things, but the day before the interview I stopped myself from reading interview posts and anything related to it. It eased my nerves a lot. I was way more relaxed than my family members lol.
- And the most important thing is to pray and make lots of dua. InshaAllah you’ll be fine.

F1 status: Approved Alhamdulilah MashaAllah 
Date: 24th June 2023
Interview time: 9:15am
Actual interview: 11:45am 
Karachi Consulate 
Although there were few minor mishaps that happened too that day but i tried to remain calm and relaxed throughout and managed to convince the VO to approve my visa Alhamdulilah. At first i wasn’t given any token number and when i realized that i have no token number, i went back and got token number of much later time 
 Next, i was instructed to bring another passport size photo from the nearest studio as early as possible as my current picture wasn’t acceptable since i was wearing a hijab and some sides were not visible (according to them). Anyways, i went to the nearest studio (Dosani’s) and came back after an hour. And waited half an hour more to have my interview. 
I greeted him, he ignored and had a straight bezaar face. VO was a male. He asked me to pass my documents. I did. 
VO: So why are you going to US
Me: To pursue dual Masters in public informatics and urban planning from Rutgers University, New Jersey.
VO: Hold on, whats public informatics? Is it related to public health? 
Me: No its not related to public health, its related to data analytics. I tried explaining him the relevancy of this field with my field and how it aligns with my bachelors degree. He was listening me carefully and even typed it on his computer and i think read it online too on Rutgers website. I even mentioned few data related courses like GIS, Envi, python and he was like now whats GIS? So I explained him in detail about that too. 
VO: Okay so i see you have also gotten a 60% scholarship. How are you managing remaining funds? 
Me: My family is going to sponsor my education; that includes my father and two brothers. 
VO raised his eyebrows and looked at me.
I gave him my father’s background and of my brothers background. He asked me to pass their financial documents. He carefully saw each of those documents and verified the amount that i was stating while telling him about my father and brothers earnings and savings. I also told him about couple of investment lands that we own and their worth in dollars. 
Vo: Whats the status of your brothers in US?
Me: One of them is on H1B and another one has just started his professional hybrid masters program. 
Vo: Okay and what are your future plans? 
Me: Told
By that time he already took out a paper which i didn’t see which color that was. But he seemed satisfied and was smiling. 
Me: Last but not the least, one interesting fact is that when i first visited USA back in 2020, I got the chance to explore the campus of Rutgers New Brunswick, so this was also one of the reasons of selecting Rutgers apart from scholarship and its outstanding reputation. I am familiar with the place and have explored the campus for days. 
Vo: Thats wonderful. Congratulations i am approving your Visa. Im keeping your passport. Thankyou. Bye bye 
Me: Thankyou so much. Have a nice day. 
My advice: Be confident and well prepared. And dont be hideous at all. They already know everything about you and I could’ve said something else on the question of my brothers status but i chose to be honest and straightforward. 
Best of luck to everyone. Prayers for all. 
Allahumma Barik

VO: Any realtives or friends in the US?

me: mother and siblings

VO: congratulations your visa has been approved you can collect your passport on next Friday.
I might have missed some of the qs but the interview lasted for about 5 minutes. The VO seemed already annoyed and he had rejected 2 people infront of me and was not in a good mood. He was constantly looking at the computer screen. After each question there was a break a long one aswell. I couldn't catch anything from his expressions. I prepared myself as much as I could but it was mostly because of my prayers and faith in Allah. I would advise everyone to do the same. First prepare yourself fully and then trust Allah's plan. I felt very bad for the refused people but there's a reason to HIS plan. 
Any questions are welcome.

Me: ok thank you.
THE TRICK IS to be Confident and natural like these questions don’t even matter and don’t get stuck while speaking. Try to stay to the point and not give a comeplete story for every answer you give.
My Experience: I came alone to a place near the embassy to stay. At 1 am I realized My mother hadn’t signed my I-20 I forgot to tell her to sign it.
My friend photostated my I-20 from the call center I worked at and delivered it to my home. 
At 2 am my parents left from Peshawar to give me the signed form. Then they asked to drop me off even tho it was just 5:30, I agreed and found out The roads were blocked and we had to take a long route.
I found out no InDriver no careem no Uber were available at the time. So it was a miracle my family came to drop me off. 
If I hadn’t forgotten to sign my form, my family wouldn’t have had come to drop me off and there’s a chance I would have messed things up 
But Thanks to Allah almighty things worked out.
Moral of the story if it’s written for you it will happen if it’s not Allah has better plans for you. Try try again
Best of Luck everyone May Allah bless us All

Masters in Engineering Management
Interview date: 16 June 2023
Time: 8:00 AM
VO  was a lady in her early 30’s
Me: Hey! Good Morning Mam
VO: Good Morning, How are you?
Me: I am Fine, what about you?
VO: I am fine too. Thanks for asking. Pass me your documents.
Me: Sure.
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going to pursue my Masters degree in Engineering management from XYZ University.
VO: Which degree have you recently completed?
Me: I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from XYZ University in karachi.
VO: When did you graduated?
Me: I graduated in October 2022.
*She was constantly typing on computer, there was 5-6 seconds gap after this question, so I started telling her that when I was in USA  in 2021, so I visited this university physically and met the ABC professor and ABC Professor, they both cooperate with me so much, and Dr. ABC gave me whole university tour, and also show me the research facility of Engineering management including all labs.*
VO: You were on your pleasure trip so why did you go to this city? As it is not a tourist city. Did you just go to specially visit this university?
Me: No no, I was on tour of Las vegas, los angeles and Orlando but in last I visited this city because my cousin live just 30 minutes away from this city, and he was giving me tour of beaches and several museums, during that I saw this university and planned to visit it on other day. My cousin is also a F1 student, studying in XYZ University.
VO: Oh Ok! So you were visiting your cousin in that city.
Me: Yes Mam.
VO: In how many universities did you applied?
Me: I just applied in this university, because I have physically visited this university so I was well aware of this university and city. As my CGPA is …….., so you know there are few better universities where we could apply.
VO: *nodded her head* Yes, you are right.
Me: As there is no consultant involved in my case, all I have done by my own after doing proper research between few universities. Rather than wasting my money and time by applying to several universities, I just focused on few universities and finalized this one. I also got a scholarship of ……… amount.
VO: You have done a good job! So what’s your plan to do ahead, I mean in which sector do you want to do certifications or job?
Me: I want to go towards the sustainable energy sector, as my FYP was also regarding that so I have much information on sustainable energy. 
*I explain here my FYP in few lines*
VO: Interesting. So tell me about your masters degree that is there just generally engineering management or you have to take any selective sub-field in that?
Me: In this university, there are several sub-field under engineering management, such as robotics and automation, supply chain management, civil engineering focus, Industrial Engineering focus, Mechanical engineering focus and chemical engineering focus.
VO: So, what you are going to pick?
Me: I will choose mechanical engineering focus, as my bachelors is in same field so I have a vast knowledge of it.
VO: Right! Why did you want to do masters degree?
Me: If I would be just having bachelors degree so it would be having not that much worth. If I want to get promoted to higher level so I must have a masters degree too. Well, I selected this program rather than selecting same program as my bachelors, the main reason is that if you want to go to management level post like to the highest post like CEO, so you must have management degree. What mostly engineers do is that they pursue simple MBA for this reason, and I think that if I would be doing MBA which is a business degree, after my BE Mechanical, so it would be like that I am throwing my technical field degree in dust bin. Therefore, I choose this program which is combination of management and engineering fields.
VO: Ok, right! What are you doing right now like are you studying any course or doing any job or something else?
Me: I am currently working in XYZ company as a mechanical engineer, you may see in my application that I have written NO in job section because when I booked my appointment so till then I was unemployed, but after 2 days of it I got a call from my CEO for vacant position of mechanical engineer. This is the same company where I had done my 2 months internship in month of December and January, as I was having a good working relation with my CEO so I asked him during my last days of internship that if there would be any vacancy of engineer post so he must let me know. I’ll be going on study leave, and it has been granted to me along with surety that when I will be back so I will be promoted to XYZ post due to my masters in engineering management. Do you want to see those letters?
VO: No, I don’t want to see anything, just you tell me verbally, its ok.
*she was constantly typing, so to gain her attention I start talking about my Exchange program trip to USA in 2016, where we were guest of University of Toledo, after hearing this she start talking to me again*
VO: So how long was your trip?
Me: It was just for 15 to 16 days, and I also got just 20 days visa for it. You may see it in my passport.
VO: Yeah, most of the time for exchange program, only limited time visa is granted. So, when you were in that city where you are going to do masters, what did you like there and what did you didn’t like?
Me: I love it, the calmness, its nature and the people are so much caring and lovely. There is not a single thing which I could say that I didn’t like. 
VO: Not a single thing! There must be anything that you may have thought that this shouldn’t be like this?
Me: No mam, seriously, there is not a single thing like that. That whole city is amazing.
VO: Good. Ok! (She start smiling ) So I am approving you visa. Good luck for your trip to USA. Hope you will like it. Well, we are also conducting pre-departure orientation ( she gave me blue slip along with the orientation pamphlet), I would suggest you to register yourself and must attend this, it would be helpful. 
Me: Sure Mam, I will definitely come to attend this. Thank you so much.
Me: Bye mam, have a nice day.
Vo: Thank you, you too.

Date: 26 September
Embassy: Islamabad
Status: approved (I had a prior refusal in 2022 in B2)
Appointment time: 7:45
The 
embassy was quite empty when I arrived and I believe I was the 4th or 5th person in the interview when counters opened.
Visa officer was a young American lady and pretty nice and friendly.
VO: Good morning! How are you doing?
Me: I am fine thank you for asking. How are you?
VO: I’m good. Why are you going to US?
Me: I’m going there to pursue my masters in business analytics from the University of Central Oklahoma.
Me: alright! Why did you choose this uni?
Me: Actually my sister referred this university to me initially since she is already studying in the US and then I researched about it from my end as well. I found the coursework to align quite well with my future goals because I plan to join the banking sector of here as a business analyst and there was this specific course of predictive analytics I really wanted to study since it is quite useful in the banking sector and UCO offered it so I went with it and everything seemed good. I also scored a partial scholarship.
VO: Ok so two of your sisters study over there?
Me: No my elder sister is studying over there only.
VO: And what is she studying over there?
Me: she is doing her associate in nursing.
VO: who is sponsoring her?
Me: my father.
VO: so he is also going to sponsor you right?
Me: Yes entirely

VO: which bank?
Me: Bank of Punjab, it’s a government bank.
VO: what is his exact grade?
Me: Executive vice president.
VO: Nice. Do you have any travel history?
Me: Yes I went to Saudi Arabia in 2016 with my entire family and recently went to UAE in December 2022.
VO: Great. Do you know anyone else in the US?
Me: not from my fast family but my brother in law is also over there.
VO: I see. (Spent almost 30 seconds typing something on the computer and then came the final verdict)
VO: congratulations your visa has been approved. Thank you for coming. You will receive your passport in almost a week. Have a nice day.
Me: Thank you so much. Have a nice day!
The overall time of interview was 4-5 mins I think at max and the entire time, I tried my best to stay confident and keep a nice smile on my face. The officer was quite understanding and took interest in what I said. Also, main thing is surprisingly all 3 people before me and 2 people after me got their visa accepted.
This group honestly helped me a lot in the preparation and even though I was quite nervous till the end (because I had a few weak things in my case; my sister was studying in the US, her daughter was born there and is a US national, my entire family already has valid visas, I have been previously refused), I believe I aced the interview. 
Also, ARGO Visa’s Youtube channel is honestly very very useful.

Thanks.
Important points you should consider before applying for the F1 visa.
1)If you going for studies in the USA then you have to do the entire process without the support of any consultant, otherwise, your visa will be rejected.
2)You have to be very confident while you are communicating with the visa officer.
3) Your dress matters a lot, always prefer to wear simple and dark-colored clothes for the visa interview.
4)Always try to work on your grooming if you are planning for the visa interview (Beard, Hair Cut, Hair Colour, and Clean Shave) Everything should be up to date.
5) Try to keep a smile on your face while giving the interview.
6) If you do not know how to apply to a US university or even how to apply for a visa then you have to select the other country, USA is not the right place for you. Your input really matters.
7) Stop giving answers in YES or NO (Your answer should be at least one line).
Thank you so much Rana Ibrar and Mahwish Moazzam for your continuous effort and support. That was impossible without your assistance. God Bless you.

 PLEASE APPROVED
Hello everyone I hope you guys doing well I just want to confirm few things before my interview... Need your suggestions seniors!!! 
1) My marksheets are not attested from HEC, my university didn't ask for it, is it necessary for visa? I completed intermediate 
2) 
What if the amount we show in a bank statement for i-20 is taken out from the account and put it back  before interview date..so is it fine? My father is a business man and that's why he never hold cash for a long time in his account. 
3) can I use the same bank statement which I used to receive i-20.

VO: Ok so, you can take these documents back and we've approved your visa. (Passed me the blue slip while smiling)
Me: thank you. (Smiled back)
VO: Enjoy your stay with your family. (Said happily)
( For most of the time, she kept looking and typing at the screen. Didn't look at me for longer than a second or two during each of my answers. Also my answers were brief and to the point so she didn't have to look for long either.
I kept an eye contact during the whole interview and also maintained a bit smile throughout my interview though it went quite long and I had to wait a lot in between too.
I had a plus point of already having a visit visa so I used that in start while answering the question of why I chose that uni. As I heard that the VO may have not gone through all your data so you should convey them such info yourself.
Though my answers were not in detail but i did prepare myself for any type of detail. I made a list of all possible questions and prepared the detailed answers then filtered out the important information only.  Saved the detail for only the case if they themselves ask me to go into.
You should definitely have all the information about the university you're applying to. They should not get the idea that you've selected a university without doing any proper research)

My sponsor is xyz and he has a business based in pakistan. (Gave some details of his business here to avoid usual follow up questions regarding sponsor. 
VO: Your visa is approved. 
The interview was of one minute at max. I had an upper hand because of being a issued a tourist visa earlier but most people were getting accepted that day. 
A few pointers for people who would be applying:
- Aim for universities that have a QS ranking of under 500. 
- Apply to multiple universities (3-5) as it shows the student's interest in studying. 
- Try applying to a field that is related to your current work experience or undergraduate degree. 
All they really see is the student's authenticity and his ability to come back after studies. If they have any doubt about the student staying there or going to earn money, they will reject your visa. 
All the best, may Allah make the process easy for everyone.

FALL 2024 USA BACHELORS STUDENT and future BS applicants
So my visa got approved yesterday for bachelors in CS – The University of Southern Mississippi (100% tuition fee scholarship)
A lot of people have been asking me about how I received multiple scholarships for BS programs within the United states.
Three reasons
1- GPA (1088/1100 in matric | 4 As in A’ levels)
2- SAT (1360/1600- 700/800 in Math 660/800 in English)
3- Extra co-curricular activities (President of debating and declamation club, led an NGO of interfaith abuse and violence, tree plantation/ration packages/water filtration plant in Cholistan drives, internships and blah blah)
So I’ll lay out the process for Fall 2024, if you want to receive a 100% scholarship and more.
I currently have a 110% scholarship from USM (100% rn. will get additional 4k in July), 100% from Stetson University, Presidential award from Siena College and Founders Scholarship from Ferris State University.
Step 1: START EARLY
I cannot emphasize how much starting early is important in order to receive a scholarship. If you’re going for Fall 2024 then you should start your prep this summer.
I, as a fall 2023 applicant, took my SAT in August 2022. I applied to all of the universities that offer full scholarships BEFORE OCTOBER 1, 2022. 
Yes. A year early. A lot of universities have strictly mentioned on their websites that their scholarship will be given to students who apply before a specific date. It’s usually October 1.
There are three options you can apply:
 
ED (Early Decision):
 It is a binding decision. If you get into that university, you are legally bound to go to that university. Higher acceptance ratio
EA (Early Action):
You apply early. Deadlines around a year before the start of the semester. It is non-binding. High acceptance ratio. Less competitive. More chances of hefty scholarships
RD or Rolling (Regular Decision):
 Deadlines around 3-6 months before the start of semester
Step 2: SAT
A v basic thing: NO SAT = NO 100% SCHOLARSHIP (unless you’re able to prove you’re Einstein ki aulad and shit). Even though the option of going SAT optional exists, there are hardly any universities that offer handsome scholarships to SAT optional students.
The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It’s also used by universities in Pakistan like LUMS, IBA, NUST, etc. Based on a bit of advanced English and almost matric wali maths but theoretical so cramming won’t help.
1500+: you have a good chance for Ivy league and other top 25 universities
1450+: Merit based full rides and 100% scholarships
1360+: 100%+ scholarships
See? A lot of universities offer merit based scholarships. Meaning they don’t care what you did in your school, they just want your GPA and SAT score.
Step 3: Reach out and research
It’s never a shame to ask queries that can help you. Join groups on Facebook like this one and COALI. Post your queries. Ask for help. People are always willing to help.
Research about universities and scholarships. Go to Reddit r/intl2usa and check it all out. Check which universities offer aid to international students. CSS or IFSAA. Check for fee waivers. Everything is available. Just reach out and research.
Step 4: Apply
Use commonapp or scoir to apply.
Step 5: Write essays and stuff
A lot of universities require you to write essays that reflect what you are. Hire a counsellor if you have money (4-8 lakhs) or use CHATGPT or freelancers to write your essays if you’re not exceptional at descriptive writing
Attaching a sample below that I wrote for Villanova University
Villanova University
Question:
St. Augustine states that well-being is “not concerned with myself alone, but with my neighbor’s good as well.”  How have you advocated for equity and justice in your communities? 250 words
Answer draft:
“He is a Shiite; do not eat with him”. 
I was unable to conceal my shock and disbelief as I struggled to comprehend and process the ""advice"" I had just heard. I did not interact with the ""reliable advisor"" at the time, but later, I kept contemplating about what had happened to me and my friend. This was the first time I realized how prevalent sectarian and interfaith prejudice and hatred was in the community around me, and how frequently minorities were subjected to such horrific discrimination, hate, and prejudice.
The more people I spoke to and read about, the more heinous the world seemed to me. Because I was unable to stomach the internalized hatred that my society had so casually instilled in itself.  My moral conscience had always prohibited me from treating anyone wrongfully because of their ideologies, faith or race. I was aware that this was wrong and that I needed to take action. I collaborated with the ""Hifz-o-Amaan"" Foundation, an NGO working to reduce sectarian and interfaith violence and injustices. As the campus ambassador, I promoted tolerance and raised awareness regarding religious extremism by arranging events with minority groups, visiting churches on Christmas Day to exchange gifts, and hosting joint activities with them. I was aware that spreading awareness and love, one person at a time, may treat social diseases like this of hatred and prejudice because indeed, it is the people are that constitute society.
Step 6: Maintain liaison
Keep a daily check at your mail. Universities will ask for additional documentations and stuff. Be ready to reply to them within one day.
Baqi duaen kru boss. Allah hi krta hai sab. Sab ussi ne krna hai. Humari tau bss koshish hi hai. Result dena uska kaam hai.

Interview: 16th June 2022
Interviewer: A lady
PhD Civil Engineering, University of Kansas.
Morning Mam,
VO: 
Morning
Questions:
What's University name in US? 
KU
What's your Major? 
Civil Engineering
Why were you in China? 
Study
Was that on scholarship? 
Yes
Had a same major in China?
Yes
Which University in China? 
Told
What's your proposed research in US? 
Told
So you have an assistantship, who's is your supervisor? 
I told her the name of my supervisor, she searched the internet and she asked me to spell it because she couldn't find it.  Then I passed her the CV of my supervisor and when she saw his profile, she searched on the internet again.  After typing a few seconds, she told me that, ""I'm approving your visa."" Congratulations.
#Tips
: Be confident and answer to the point, no need to explain. 
#Experience
: If you are having travel history and an assistantship then the interview is just a formality.
#Feeling
: I was feeling excited but once the shuttle bus driver and some other workers saw the ""approval slip"" in my hand they asked for ""Methai"".  I ignored them once but they kept asking for methai which was very annoying.  They have no ethics.  I spent 4 years in China and this was my second day in Pakistan after 4 years.  I saw many beggars on Islamabad road's and even in the embassy office today.

Got my F1 visa approved on my second attempt today alhamdulillah.
First visa attempt:
https://m.facebook.com/groups/1541028822851688/permalink/3483379868616564/?mibextid=Nif5oz
Second attempt:
I stumbled a lot in reply to the first question and was sure that the visa officer would reject me again but it didn't happen this time. 
I believe it was because I answered all questions in relation to how the degree would help me in Pakistan.
Here's how the second attempt went:
Visa officer: What school are you going to?
Me: xyz school (not mentioning some details for anonymity) for a master's degree in business analytics.
VO: Why are you going to this school?
Me: I'm going to this school because the program they offer teaches information in the context of business first. As I plan to start my own business after coming back, a degree from this school would help my plans a lot. (Stuttered a lot and got confused and barely gave a coherent response but this was the gist of it).
VO: You only applied to this school?
Me: Yes. I was going to apply to abc school too but I was procrastinating and then I ended up getting accepted in xyz school. It was my first choice anyway so I didn't apply to the second school.
VO: Why did you choose this degree at xyz school?
Me: Like I mentioned previously, I plan to start my own data analytics business after coming back and because this degree teaches skills in the context of business, that's why I am choosing this degree.
VO: What business would you like to start?
Me: I have been working for x type of companies for the last 5 years. I plan to start my own company in this field.
VO: How did you find out about this school? Not many Pakistani students apply here.
Me: I spend a lot of time on a data science community online and I saw an ad in that community of the university. I researched the program and it appeared to be aligned with my interests so I chose to apply here.
VO: How will you sponsor your studies?
Me: I have a scholarship of x amount. The rest is through self-finance. I have been making a salary of x per month which I've saved. I'll use that to pay for my degree.
VO: Can I see your bank statements?
Me: (passed my statements) Btw my brother has also agreed to sponsor me in case I run into any deficit.
VO: What does your brother do?
Me: He works in the data science field and lives in Saudi Arabia.
VO: Do you have any relatives in US?
Me: Yes, my brother lives in Chicago. 
VO: Is he an immigrant? What does he do?
Me: No, he's not an immigrant. He's an engineer at x company.
VO: Your visa is approved.
I had to remove a few details but I'm fairly certain that the reason why I got a visa this time was because I answered a few times why this degree would help my future plans. I have given a brief summary in my answers but I know that I talked about my future business at least 3-4 times and how this degree will help me start that business.
Some tips:
1. When the VO asks you why you want to go for this university, try to answer the question in a way that ties back to your plans and how this school will help you achieve the plans. Your answer should mention that this school will help you gain __ skills which will help you do __ when you come back to Pakistan. This school is the best option of gaining __ skills hence why you chose it.
Last time, I gave a generic answer (this university has a good ranking, the program teaches machine learning etc etc). The VO didn't even listen to my full answer.
2. Stumbling in the beginning thankfully didn't hurt my chances. I was stuck quite badly in the first answer and thought for sure the VO will have a bad impression but that didn't happen, so if this happens to you, don't lose your cool and try to answer the rest of the questions as confidently as you can.
3. In my DS 160, in the section where you're supposed to explain if you have gotten any rejections in the past, I wrote a whole essay.
I mentioned how I had been sick at my last attempt and that affected the way I answered my questions. I mentioned that I failed to clarify my sponsorship and didn't explain why I had resigned from my job so that got me rejected. I gave all explanations in that essay. 
I don't know if it helped me or not but the VO this time asked me no questions about my first rejection so maybe it did?
4. If the VO asks you if there's anything new about your application this time after your first rejection, always say yes and try to give information you didn't give them the first time around.

Today was my second attempt at Islamabad. Everything went well but previous vo may be had given a sort of remark due to which I have got 221g. She told me to submit docs then they will ask for passport. The thing is my classes are going to start on 28 August. I already have emailed my prospective university about doc requirements. Can anyone suggest should I defer semester or not?
One more thing I have not done any sort of research nothing except laboratory work which is done in Pakistan. The required documents which they have asked also include any research work done previously. now what should I attach with it?

My advise for everyone, just be confident and be an active speaker. If they ask you a question, dont just answer them in a single word but start talking like ur having a normal conversation. They literally listen to your jargon even if it makes no sense lol. My sister lives in USA, but they didnt even ask me about her neither they asked for any other documents. 
Ek din pehle kisi dawat mai chale jaana taake uncles aise personal sawal tumse puche so that u know exactly what to answer. Thats exactly what i did lmao. 
Best of luck everyone.

Interview date = 15 Aug
Status = approved 
V.O= long beard man
Time slot = 10.30 am
First Question = how many admits you got
Answer = i got admission in 3 out of 4 universities in which i applied. Unfortunately wasn’t able to make it to university of rochester. Also named the universities and their business schools in which i got admit
2nd = why this xyz university 
Ans= Told MSBA at xyz is ranked among top 100 MsBa programs in the world according to Qs rankings. Also told in detail about the diversity of curriculum 
3rd= how many brothers you have
Ans = told 1 and also about his profession
4Th= who is financing you
Ans= told i have got scholarship of about 5K and have personal savings of around 8k and the rest of cost which is almost 43 k is going to be paid by my father. 
He asked about his business and i gave him the details 
5th= he asked me about my mother’s sister who lives in US
Ans= i told him that i have no immediate relative but about other relatives I already had mentioned in my Ds-160. He didn’t bother about it because she lives in different state than the state in which I have got acceptance..
Conclusion = 
Before the start of interview i had got the confidence that I would get visa because VO gave quite time to a student before me and listened him comprehensively before rejecting his visa so i got the feeling that if he gives me that chance i ll have the chances to get the visa. No doubt it is game of luck . And also the VO who is quite young was also giving alot of opportunity to speak . Women VO had more interviews from non-F1 categories and she put most of these cases to administration processing

---
VO: Please pass your documents. (She spent a lot of time looking at her screen and my I20.)
VO: Why the US?
(I feel like I fumbled here but I just answered how the US is the best at research and my program and that’s why I want to pursue my masters there at (my uni))
VO: Why (this uni)? (it’s in the top 20 of my grad program, btw)
(I gave my reasons and I also mentioned that I talked to current students and alumni.)
VO: How many people did you talk to?
(I told her about the students I talked to and the staff at uni I talked to, as well as the information seminars I attended.)
VO: Why this course?
(I talked about my major, its application in research, and how im interested in pursuing a career in this field.)
VO: What kind of research?
(I told her the kind of diseases im interested in studying.)
VO: What diseases specifically?
(I told her about the two diseases im interested in researching that are also prevalent in my community.)
[P.S: I had experience managing these diseases as a doctor.]
VO: Where do you work currently?
(I told her my job title in clinical research and my work place)
VO: What do you do in your job exactly?
(I elaborated on my duties in my current job.)
VO: How will this course help you? What kind of career can you have?
(I elaborated on how research is something ive already been involved in since my undergrad years and im continuing that. And I told her the several different jobs I can get here in Pakistan. And how it’s a step up from my current work and job title.)
VO: Where would you find these jobs here (in Pakistan)?
(I told her about the place I want to work at in my city and the person there im interested in working with. I also mentioned my current workplace.)
VO: So you’re a medical doctor?
Me: Yes
VO: When did you graduate?
Me: three years ago
VO: Where did you graduate from?
(I told her my university name.)
VO: Where is this college?
Me: Here in ___ (my city) right next to the ____________hospital.
VO: What did you do since?
(I talked about my jobs since graduating. My intern year and then of course my current job.)
VO: Whos sponsoring you?
Me: My uncle and aunt and a Dean’s scholarship.
(I told her the names of my sponsors, and how the scholarship was merit based.)
VO: What do they do?
(I told her each of their job titles and place of work)
VO: (Again confirmed my uncle’s workplace).
Me: Yes.
(She was typing a lot and looking at something on her screen while I talked about my sponsors)
VO: Do you have any financial documents of your uncle and aunt. Anything I can see now?
Me: Yes, I have their bank statements and affidavit of financial support. Would that be fine?
VO: Yes.
Me: Sorry they have these post-it/tags on them
VO: That’s fine.
Me: Okay here you go. (I also ended up giving both their passport copies)
VO: Oh so theyre separate people, not married to each other?
Me: Oh no no, theyre both separate people, not related.
VO: Where do they live?
Me: My uncle lives here in (my city) at ____ and my aunt lives in ____ (abroad, not US)
VO: (She sifted through everything; the bank statements, my I20, and was carefully reading even the affidavit. I should highlight here that I assume my last two rejections for the B1/B2 visa were because of my finances, which is probably why she was carefully reading everything in my case. Just my opinion.)
VO: Alright I see you have enough for one academic year. What about your second year?
Me: Yes, I have the Dean’s scholarship well into my second year as well, and my uncle and aunt will continue to support me.
VO: Okay.
(Then she was reading through something on the screen. She was doing this a lot during my interview and overall for others too maybe, cause other people were standing idly by her counter as well for a while.)
VO: I see you have previous rejections, was that trip for the USMLE? (many interviewees that day were going for their USMLE Step 3 or clinical rotations, just btw)
Me: Um, not exactly. I was also going for my clinical electives at ______ (this is a top ranked university in the US) where I had the chance to work with Dr ____ and another clinical elective at ______ (a famous research hospital in the US) to work with Dr ____. (I was excitedly telling her about the Drs because I genuinely find them both to be amazing)
VO: Are you not giving USMLE now?
Me: No. As I said, I am not pursuing a clinical career anymore. Im pursuing research.
VO: (I don’t recall the exact question. She asked me to elaborate on my career change. Like why I wasn’t practicing as a medical doctor and why I’m currently pursuing this degree and research?)
(I told her about when I switched and what led me to change my career to research. I just answered honestly.)
VO: How have your circumstances changed since then?
(I got confused because I thought I already elaborated on my career change so I mentioned it again and how this is for a masters degree.)
VO: No, what has changed? Did your sponsors not fund your trip last time?
Me: Oh no, my aunt and uncle weren’t my sponsors then. It was my father. He was sponsoring my trip last time.
VO: What do your parents do?
VO: How come your aunt and uncle are sponsoring you this time? How did that happen? (again, I don’t remember her exact words but she wanted me to elaborate why I made this change and how my aunt and uncle came to be my sponsors this time)
(I explained how they became my sponsors. They have been supportive of me throughout my application cycle and offered to fund my education. And I accepted.)
VO: Okay.
(Then she kept reading something. Kept scanning my passport. Was mostly looking at her screen during my interview. This felt like forever.)
VO: Alright, everything looks okay.
(Now this I was unprepared for, what should I say now lol. Should I say thanks or okay? So I just kept quiet lol)
VO: Im approving your visa! (Then she went on to explain how I will get my passport in 3-5 days, that she will keep my passport but return my I20 and SEVIS page. How I should keep this safe and make sure to bring it with me while travelling for the US Port of Entry I guess. I was in sheer shock so I was just blankly staring)
Me: Thank you! Thank you, hope you have a wonderful day ahead!
Took my documents and my folder and just rushed out.
The interview was longggg, as you can read. My VO was taking long interviews of nearly everyone I could see in that counter but it was not necessarily a bad thing. A lot of them were approved; you just had to be concise in your answers. The length itself can be intimidating, but if you’re honest and you’ve done your homework it will go well inshaAllah.
My brothers were a great source of help for me. They conducted my mock interviews and helped me throughout. One of my brothers is on an F1 visa in the US and I mentioned it in the DS160 form as well. But as you can read, she asked me nothing about that. I even mentioned an uncle in the US in my previous DS160 form for my B1/B2 applications, but she asked nothing about that either.
I reached out to many Pakistani students in the US through friends and friends of friends who all told me about their visa experiences and how it’s so straightforward and nothing to worry about. They were all super supportive and encouraging as well.
I used this group and the F1 visa experiences group on facebook a lot to gauge the kind of questions I could be asked and to learn from other people’s experiences. I made it a point to read mostly the approved posts. The rejected posts, though a lot more in number, serve to discourage and demotivate you. But yes, you can also learn from them. I still suggest reading mostly the approved posts. I even reached out to 
Rana Ibrar
 who was so gracious with his time and advice and guided me. He conducted a mock interview, told me about all possible questions, and was overall very motivating. He basically said: Your visa is approved! Long before I heard it in the consulate lol. JazakAllah Abrar!
Good luck to everyone applying. The 3Cs mentioned in this group’s featured post is spot on, and you will find anyone on the internet saying the same. Your finances, credibility as a student, and your commitment to the course and country and laws is what’s important. Which they will gauge from your interview mostly. If you are a genuine student and your finances are in order you should have no problem getting that visa inshaAllah.

Visa issued: 25th october 2022
Embassy location: Karachi
Visa status: Approved on 1st attempt alhamdulillah(Arrived in USA on 28th December 2022)
Interviewer was a short haired blondie on counter 3
***PS. The interview was long as I tried to drag it as much as possible, so I will try to write as much as I can remember bear with the long post I hope it can be helpful***
Me: Hello
VO: Hey, how are you?
Me: I am good, I hope you are doing well too.
VO: thank you, May I have your picture
Me: Sure, here you go?
VO: How much time has passed since you got this captured?
Me: Maybe 2 months or a little over I don’t remember exactly.
VO: Is your picture edited?
Me: Oh yes, I guess it is as I got it taken at a studio
VO: Alright, may I have your documents please?
Me: You mean the bundle they made at first security check?
VO: Yeah that’s the one
Me: Here you go!
VO: Thank you (takes a glance at my documents and started typing away on her computer vigorously)
Me: Pleasure is all mine!
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going for higher studies, masters in civil engineering precisely.
VO: (continues typing while asking) Which university did you applied to?
Me: Oh I applied to 4 universities and got accepted at Lamar university
VO: Where else did you applied to?
Me: I applied at 3 other universities *told the names*, I originally planned to go for bridgeford but the communication with them was not so efficient and Lamar had swift responses so I thought why not!
VO: Can you tell me about your bachelors course?
Me: You mean the whole curriculum or the background of what it was about?
VO: Yeah the background (still focusing on her computer)
***BTW a handful tip try to get the interviewers’ attention because that is actually an indication that she is interested in knowing about you and most likely to grant you a visa so stop making robotic internet responses come up with your own originality***
Me: I explained about my bachelors and research major
VO: Ok so who is funding your studies?
Me: Well ofcorse my father is funding my studies as I am a student and I don’t work plus I also was able to get scholarship on merit basis
VO: What does your father do?
Me: He is a businessman
VO: What kind of business he runs?
Me: Oh he rents out heavy machineries for road carpet finish and supplies bitumen.
VO: Sorry, what bitumen?
Me: Uh you know the finish product of the road, small black rocks used for carpeting the roads.
VO: Oh yeah I got that, so why did you chose civil engineering for masters?
(She was continuously typing at this point too and I was trying to drag the convo as much as I can so she can start talking to me actually face to face)
Me: Ok so the story goes way long back, my father supported and encouraged me a lot regarding my education and such as I have no brother he placed all his expectations on me in this regard and trained me for such so that when I grow up I can help him with the business handling and that’s the reason it became my passion to actually learn about what my father does and to help him improve I wanted to learn about it from a worldly aspect so that we can adapt the technology and methods used around the world.
VO: Oh wow that’s cool!
(She glanced at me and started typing away again and I stood there waiting but seconds felt like hours and it felt like the pause was too long so I started talking again)
Me: While doing my thesis I got lucky and my bachelors research preprint got published too which was a milestone for me.
VO: (finally she leave her computer leaned on the table and turned her whole attention towards me and that felt like an achievement at that moment TBH) Tell me more about it.
Me: So my research was about the airport management at Karachi Jinnah Intl Airport and its aspects.
VO: How is airport management related to what you want to study?
Me: Yeah the infrastructure and management aspect you know.
VO: Ohhh now that’s cool, Congratulations your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you!
***She was giving me the yellow approval slip alongwith my documents bundle from the small window and suddenly stopped either ends of the documents in each of our hands***
VO: When does your classes start?
Me: Oh they start from 17th Jan 2023.
VO: Alright you are free to go
(I took the document and went straight outside without seeing back and out where I cam from in)
***Remember you can be nervous it doesn’t matters because the officers are well aware of that no matter how hard you try to hide it it’s just going to get worse so do not bother with that but don’t lose your composure in the process this is the thing you need to work on. Never ever express your gratitudes and emotions and joyness when your visa gets approved as it is going to convey that you are desperate and most highly chance of getting rejected because they can do it that is what they are checking from the very beginning till the end, they are not interested in you because of all those robotic answers they hear all day long so make them actually talk to you, and last but not the least recite some duas for ease all the time on the way to the embassy till you stand in front of the interviewer, don’t think about acception or rejection that’s the main thing and you will automatically start to talk without any hesitation***
That’s all for now if you have any further questions feel free to ring my inbox and best of luck for thise who have upcoming interviews believe in Allah have faith in yourself and ace the interview afterall you are paying a hefty amount just to get to talk with the person and still you have to be nervous from thise who are taking your money, give yourself a prep talk and you are good to go.
Best Regards

Interview experience. F1 visa. Karachi Embassy.
Alhamdulillah got my visa approved.
They only asked for my DS 160 confirmation,SEVIS, I20 and most recent passport at the entrance. Visa officer also checked only these. Didn't ask for anything else.
VO: 
Morning
Me: Morning
Then he asked for the finger-scanning. I did it. Then he asked the first question.
Why MBA?
I was about to answer and he interrupted, ""something went wrong with prints, we will have to repeat.""
This did throw me a bit as it disrupted my thoughts flow. But I scanned my fingers again and then he repeated same question.
VO: Why MBA?
Me: I answered, it was based on personal details.
VO: Why this university?
Me: Multiple reasons. It has really good marketing program, something I am interested in majoring. It also has a cool academies program. Where students get one to one mentorship and get to work on real life business cases. Also it's somewhere I have previously attended a summer exchange program at 6 years ago. And finally, they give a really good financial aid package.
VO: (Looked at my I20). So who is paying for it?
Me: Like I said I have really good financial aid package. And for the rest I have taken out a student loan.
VO: Did you get the loan from Pakistan?
Me: No, prodigy finance.
VO: Based on what information did they approve your loan?
Me: Oh just my employment history, bank history and credit score.
VO: Do you have friends or family in USA?
Me: No, first one from my family to be going there.
VO: That's nice.
Then he typed for like a full minute or 2 which felt like ages and then said, congratulations, your visa has been approved. You will get an email when your passport is ready to be collected.
He also handed me a yellow slip saying my visa is approved and how will I collect it.
PS:. From what I read here, I thought yellow was administrative processing and blue was approval. But approval is yellow.

Alert 
My visa was rejected third time yesterday. 
I went for 3rd attempt after 45 days since second attempt. 
Visa 
officer said I can't give you visa because you were rejected two times before but I give you one advice, "" Don't waste your 185$, you will get same answer. Just give yourself some time "". 
Note: I changed universities in all three times. I knew this could be red flag but i thought as long as i have explanation, it won't be an issue. And I was laid off two months before than interview. So I appeared unemployment there but had two years of work experience. 
Question: I have to wait but how long ? Even if i waited, there is strong possibility that i won't get visa because now i have three rejections.  
I'm going to start my another job soon. 
I'm thinking for Fall 2024. 
What else should I do ? 
I'm worried even if i change my profile and waited, still they may reject by seeing three rejections. 
Betray by seeing rejections but don't want to give up. 
Please give me suggestions.

Hi everyone, 
I appeared for f2 visa and unfortunately it's rejected. Interviewer was lady in Islamabad embassy. 
I need some suggestions to improve for the next time.
Here are the questions that she asked. 
1st 
question:  What is your spouse studying?
Ans: He is doing his PhD from .... university majoring in ...... Engineering 
2nd Questions: when did you guys got married?
Ans: we got married on .... 2023 
3rd Question: how did you guys meet? 
Ans: Mam he was my first cousin so we both knew each other from childhood 
She said something about cousins marriage that I didn't understand because she was not audible to me. And she rejected. 
For F2 visa I don't have anything to change in my visa application. Mostly in the posts people say that VO starts interview by asking that what did you change in the application and why it was rejected last time. I don't have proper answers for both of these questions. 
Please give me your suggestions.  Thanks.

To the people getting rejected: I know it may seem like that you are rejected for no reason and many of you have posted sharing your concerns that you are rejected and have expressed your frustration too. So let me explain you the major reason. Before I explain you the reason let me tell you that I have received two F visas and one J visa with no travel history before my first visa. Currently I am doing my PhD. So one of the major reason is Finances.
Let’s be honest when you 
show bank statements, are you really going to be using those finances? And VO knows that! They know that the 70 lacs you are showing many of you don’t intend to use that money and just showing it to get the visa. After you get the visa, you will start thinking how you will pay for your education. So if you don’t have a full-ride or a loan, or a TA or RA ship you won’t be able to pay for your education. Don’t be misled thinking that you will be able to make sufficient money with an on-campus job, the on-campus job is only sufficient enough to pay for some of your expenses such as food, bills and sometimes rent. You can’t pay tuition and health insurance with a part time job and working full-time or working off-campus during semesters is ILLEGAL! Majority of you are rejected primarily because of your finances because your finance story doesn’t make sense. VO knows the cost of living in US, and cost of tuition, they are mentioned on your I-20. So they are well aware that you won’t be able to furnish this amount and the bank statement that you showed is probably just to show so you can get that visa. 
Yes, not getting the visa is disappointing. But it will be more disappointing once you get to US and can’t pay for your expenses. So again if you don’t have a full-ride, A TA/RA offer or majority tuition scholarship, don’t think that you will be able to manage the finances. 
Hope this helps and clears some doubts. Don’t blame the embassy or the system because if you are eligible for visa, you will get one but if you know deep down that “I am just showing these statements to get visa, I won’t be using this money” than know that VO knows this and you won’t get the visa. 
Best of luck!

I was rejected for this upcoming fall semester. 
To improve my application, I need to find a good ranked university.
The MS programs I am looking for are
Data science
Data analytics
Business Analytics
Computer science
Unfortunately my CGPA was 2.95. But I have a over 2 years of relevant work experience. Hence looking for names where i can get accepted with the CGPA and without mandatory GRE.
After my research many universities are saying that they might consider, but they usually don't. Had the same experience last term alot of money was wasted on application fees.
I will be very thankful if someone suggest me good universities with good rank for the spring semester.

Well 
I won’t right down the conversation here unlike others. But i will say they are doing completely piece of shit out there. It’s a total crap. I invested more than 2 months in this whole process and all I had to bear was extremely reluctant behaviour at the counter. The VO was least interested in taking the interview and was all set to pass me the yellow slip.

Visa Rejection and Approvals (F-1) 
Dear community, 
I have received 3 F visas in the past with no rejections. I have noticed people sharing their profiles and asking why those that have gotten visas think they were rejected. So with that, please take my advice as it suits you. 
1) 
Are you a genuine student? 
You should ask this question to yourself because life in US is not what is shown in Hollywood movies. Life is very challenging there and you being a genuine student means not increasing more issues for yourself. You can’t just change statuses easily, you can’t just start working there, you can’t just marry there, all these who create this illusions in your mind are not truthful. If your intent is to not study than do not consider applying for F visas. 
2) Can you really pay for a university that’s not offering you any scholarship?
With how the economy is of Pakistan, VO knows real well whether you will be able to pay or not. Don’t think you can just work there and pay for Tuition, health insurance, food, rent, bills, and save. You can’t do that on a 20 hour job. Also, it’s hard in a lot of universities now to get jobs and you can’t work off campus, so plan very very carefully. Don’t get yourself in that mess where you are stuck! If you can’t pay for your Tuition don’t lie about it. If you know your parents won’t be able to pay don’t get yourself in a bad shape. It’s better to go a little later with a better financial package than trying to hurry and than being in bad shape.
3) Getting rejected and immediately running for the next appointment 
Mainly those of you that get rejected are getting rejected on showing weak ties. You can’t just suddenly improve your ties in a week. Don’t rush the situation. Give yourself time to see what went wrong, is it really the university or is it that it was pretty obvious during interview that you won’t be able to pay as you say you will be or you were caught in a lie. Don’t underestimate the ability of VO to know about the circumstances. They are really good at scanning people, that’s what they do all day everyday. So lying about a situation will only get you refusals. When you get refused don’t panic and run for the next available appointment. Try to see what you can change depending upon what went wrong in your interview. 
4) Stay away from consultants! 
Applying for US visa and universities is pretty easy. It’s getting a good financial package is what’s difficult. So stay away from consultants!! They mostly are there to drain your money! I got three F visas and never went to a consultant. 
5) keep faith in yourself 
I know it’s easier for me to say that. But, losing faith in yourself will only put you in worst shape than what you are in. Always know, there are tons of places around the world where you can go study. One country is not what will define your future. Always take a step back and try applying to other countries. You might be able to get a really good package somewhere else. So don’t drain yourself emotionally or mentally! 
I hope this helps those who have been rejected and those that will apply in near future

Fingerprints done after 3 attempts
It was a very long interview.
*Note*There is possibilities that the sequence of questions might be incorrect.
My interview went very smoothly even beyond my expectations. and I was very confident.
VO: Why you specifically want to study in USA?
Me: Officer its quite different from other countries. you guys believe in giving practical exposure along with research opportunity and I really want to explore the multicultural environment of USA. apart from this usa degree will give me competitive advantage here back in Pakistan with tremendous job opportunities. 
So I will definitely experience a good learning environment. 
VO: oh so want to explore the culture as well with smile..
Me: yes Officer university life is not all about studies and I want to explore the cultural diversity of USA.
VO: thats great..
VO: you applied to any other colleges.
Me: yes Officer I applied to DePaul university, Hofstra university, UIC, southern new samphire university and Adelphi university. 
VO: So why you chose DePaul University?
Me: There were a few things that I had in mind for my university selection. The curriculum should have a dedicated career track in business analytics with real time problem solving subjects like capstone and management internship and for these courses recently depaul university has launched beta lab. It’s a virtual platform for students to solve business problem by implementing real world data using different softwares such as SAP, Oracle Tableau and power BI. Also I’m particularly interested business intelligence and big data analysis and Don Pitchell who director of business analytics program is one the top researchers in the area. So If I would get a chance to work under him as a research assistant it would be greater opportunity for me. 
VO: okay… 
Me: yes Ma’m I have also done extensive research prior to applying at DePaul University. 
VO: ohh so you have contacted any students.
Me: yes Officer I have contact with current student and I found out that students can actually interact directly with professor rather than their TA, I mean what else do I need student right.
VO: How this will relate with you future goals? 
Me:I want to pursue career as a business analyst, which is the fastest growing field literally in every sector of Pakistan. as we’re still developing country and there is a huge market gap in Building tech industry. I will definitely get a good return out of the investment. 
But Officer…

He gave a smile, seemed like he thought i was confident abt my program like know how, and stood up took my passport inside and came back
Him:Why this university?
 I did an internship at an educational consultancy where i got to know about university of UTAH then i did my research and got to know about unique majors that university is providing and big campus situated in 1526 acres, diversification of students, support system for students, i got scholarship of 35000$ across 4 years and last factor was location, which is salt lake city, it is one of the liveable cities in US and top preference for international student because of the business opportunities.
Passed me my docs with rejection slip and said sorry you’re not eligible for the visa under section 214B. 
Can anyone guide me where i went wrong as I cant seem to understand with only two questions how he rejected me. My D160 was perfect also funding and my family ties are also good as I’ll have to come back to takeover my family business.

Interview Advice for those who got rejected in first Attempt.
You may go with the same university but not with the same profile. VO will must ask you what circumstances have you change this time?
Circumstances mean ur academic, professional, financial or personal circumstances…University is not ur circumstance. 
Try to identify the reason of rejection, improve ur profile accordingly and then apply again with a gap of minimum one month for next attempt for same intake
Re-apply 
with no change in ur circumstances would be a waste of time and money.

Could someone please explain why my visa was rejected? I have provided the entire conversation below for reference.
VO Identity : Long beard Man 
Location : Islamabad 
Question: Why did you choose MIU or why MIU?
Me: MIU is economical and I can afford it easily right now. I am trained in banking software development, and there are only 32 of us who know the banking software development technology. Their course focuses on Oracle JAVA (Banking software development), which I have 
been working on for 5 years, making it beneficial for my career. My current company has committed to promoting me to a managerial position if I complete an MS in Java, so it is a great opportunity for me. He says ""Wow, great.""
Me: If you want to see it, I have a commitment letter from my company. He says ""No need.""
Me: Additionally, MIU's curriculum involves studying only one subject and taking exams at the end of each month. Also, MIU offered us CPT.
Question: I saw on your F1 Form you need $. Who will pay this fee?
Me: Sir, I am on self-finance. It's my savings, and if I need more for the next year, my father is a landlord, and he will easily pay this fee.
Question: How many universities have you applied to?
Me: Four (Drake Uni, MIU, and Mississippi Uni).
He: And which university has selected you?
Me: Drake and MIU.
He: Then why didn't you choose Drake?
Me: Actually, MIU responded first, so I continued my process with MIU.
Question: In your DS_160, I see you already did MSCS. Then why do you want to start MS again?
Me: Sir, actually, I already told you that I have been working on Java for 5 years, and my MS was in Data Science. There is no future for data science in Pakistan, so I want to start MS again, but in Java.
then he start typing completely silence  for 2 mints then i startd talking
additionally sir,  I follow Dr. abc on Google Scholar. I have published six papers internationally, so his research papers are relevant to my research, and if my visa application is approved, I'll work with him in the future.
Question: In which field did you publish your research papers?
Me: Data Sciences.
And then he gave  me a yellow rejection paper.

Hello everyone.
So got rejected in my 2nd attempt. 
Profile Adelphi University New York 
Program TESOL ( Teaching English to the speakers of other languages)
Test DUOLINGO score 110 
CGPA

Now my question is should I apply for 3rd time but I’ll enroll this time for summer intake. If anyone of you think that university itself is the reason of my rejection then on my interview date many candidate are from top ranking universities but they got rejections.
I just need your suggestions that this time which University is best for me. As I did my bachelors in English literature. What’s the best option for me?
Thank you.

All the time she was interrupted by another lady officer which engaged her in talks, and she was going inside again and again and while asking questions she was writing in her screen,  in whole interview she was in a very good mood and was very casual. I've thought that she'll give me the visa.

Interview 19th May 2023 
Rejected 
University of arizona 
Bacholars
Please everyone read it and let me know what can I improve in next interview and what were my mistakes because my classes will Start soon and I can't delay them, I already had a gap year.
Vo:show me your documents
Me: passed them
Vo: financial statement 
Me: passed them
Vo: this is just a bunch of papers
( I didn't knew what to answer about it, like I can not bring money here obviously it have to be on paper) whatever
Me: explained that this is my mother's account and it has money generated from her school/collage.
Vo: which school
Me: named the school
(It's a local school)
Vo: started typing the name of school on computer, maybe he was searching about the school.
Vo: which university 
Me: university of Arizona 
Vo: how did you got to know about it?
Me: searched about good ranking universities and so
Vo: what will you study 
Me: software engineering 
Now here I am a little confused, I can not remember what he asked for, maybe my future plan or maybe why I want to study software engineering.
Me: I proceeded to explain him that I what to convert my mother's school and collage in IT University, as all great university are in lahore  islamabad and karachi, for computer and faislabad is deprived of great universities, so students have to migrate from there to other cities which everyone can not afford. And many parents don't allow and students also have safety problem.
Vo: that's more than enough
(The reality is that, EVERYTHING I SAID HERE WAS A LIE, I DONT WANT TO PROCEED WITH THE UNIVERSITY, I WANT TO OPEN A SOFTWARE HOUSE IN PAKISTAN, but I thought that he might not be convinced with software house as it can be opened anywhere and not necessarily in pakistan, so lied about the university. I think this was kind of biggest mistake, as the person before me gave the same kind of Statement 
Like good country man, help my nation, help my brother, help My country, blah blah, something like this, so my statement also seems kind of fake created, that I want to help people of my city.)
Proceeding
Vo: any relatives there
Me: no
Vo: have you been there before
Me: no
Vo: siblings 
Me: one is AS and second one in 7th class
Vo: father
Me: banker in ...... bank 
Me added we have rental home from where get rent.
(This was not true but i had to justify the bank statement soo) 
Vo: how many
Me: 4
That's what I remember, 
Then he took some time, disappear to side or somewhere, then proceeded to give the yellow paper, 
The paper said that I could not establish ties with my country, and I am not proving that I will return.
Now things I am planning to change. 
1. Tell them the real aim, of building software house
2. Take my ntn, proof which shows that there is a school which is on my mother's name.
What else should I improve, please share your valuable views.

Guide: How to get an Emergency visa appointment for F1 visa category.
I had been very anxious over the past week as my interview appointment date was 4 days after my classes start date (on i20). 
I mailed my university asking for late arrival letter, but they rejected my request and instead sent me a letter (addressed to the embassy), asking the embessy to provide me with expedited visa interview and why it was of importance that I get an early appointment.
At first I was disappointed because there was no category for F1 visa seekers to apply for emergency, but I selected ""business"" from the dropdown menu and provided a brief explanation as to why it was important for me to get an early appointment. I uploaded my i20, letter recevied from university, and the current interview confirmation pdf.
I sent this request on friday night (29th July) and got response back on monday morning (31st July), with slots being available for this very current week!!
I have now rescheduled my interview in this week and hope my experience helps some of you guys/gals in the same boat as I was last week.
In the end all I have to say is that have faith in Allah, and pray. There is not much that you can control in this situation so just try your best and stay positive in any case.
PS: In case you found this post helpful, please remember me in your prayers as I will be appearing for interview in a couple days. Also I request you to kindly not ask me to dm unless absolutely necessary and ask questions in the comments as it will benefit others down the road too. I saw so many dead posts regarding this topic so I finally decided to make one (I almost didn't even apply for emergency appointment because I thought there was no point in doing it).
PS2: Everything above is just based on my own personal experience and I am in no way an expert in this matter.

But never for an F1
Should I select the visa refused category when searching for dates, or the other one?

Also, what are chances of rejection with a very good university, like top 30 universities of USA?

Hello guys, I had my visa interview yesterday and it got rejected. During the interview the VO asked me about my bank statement, i showed it to her and then she goes where did all these funds come from? I replied that my father transfered all the funds from our family saving account to this account to carry out my university expenses? She said do you have the statement for the family savings account, I didn’t had it with me that time and after two three questions she rejected 
my visa. also note my father opened this account in December 2022 , do you think this could be the reason for rejection?

Hello guys today i had my interview
Visa : approved
Literally no question was asked I just went there greeted her. No document was checked and asked for. The VO was a lady who herself was from penn state and joked with me that penn state has the best ice cream and then she approved my visa.
Edit: people are saying that how lucky Iam, but that is not the case. I already had a very strong case and had no reason to be rejected. I was already a B1/B2 visit visa holder. I had visited USA 4 times and always returned showing I had strong ties to my country and most of all I had an outstanding university (you can check). The VO also being from penn state acted as a cherry on top.

Assalam-o-Alaikum all I'm in need of your assistance. My visa application has been rejected twice at the Islamabad Embassy, despite receiving a generous scholarship offer from the university. My challenge lies in the fact that I have already completed my Master's degree. Whenever I attend the interview, the first question I am asked is why I wish to pursue a second Master's degree, and this is where my visa application gets denied. Therefore, I kindly request your guidance on 
how to secure admission for a Ph.D. program. My academic background includes an MSCS (Data Science) degree with 3.37/4.00 cgpa with research , and I am looking for an economically viable option with available scholarships and a streamlined application process. Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

My F1 was rejected in October on 214b and i have reapplied for December.
I have changed my sponsor. Initially I was the only sponsor and now i have shown my father as the main sponsor, i also got 5000 USD scholarship from university and around 9000 USD i am showing as a community loan which i will be taking after visa approval.
How do I answer the question about why i have changed so much in my finances in just 2 month time as initially i said i have the required funds to cover 
my complete education and now I have showing a loan and my father as sponser.
Need advise how to answer this!

It’s going pretty good. Pass me your documents .

Vo: Okay ! How many universities you’ve applied ?
Me: I applied to 5 universities in 5 different states !
Vo: can you name them !
Told !!
Vo: Why this university ?
Me: I have various reasons but mainly because of my dean, Mr. scott beaulier he is PHD from George Mason university and have more than 10 years of professional experience and i believe i can learn alot under his supervision moreover the overall faculty was very helpful and cooperative.
Vo: Do you have someone in the states?
Me: Yes my brother is there !
Then he asked me questions about him and his face expression totally changed after he came to know my brother is there !!
I know that is why my visa is refused.
But overall it was really a bad day at embassy , I have seen only two girls getting blue slips otherwise it felt like a yellow day at embassy!
I was pretty much confident and was not nervous.
If anyone else got a visa today please share the experience and Congratulations to those two girls 
Good Luck to those who have interviews scheduled in next days :))

Looking for the genuine help! 
I've been rejected twice in the F1 Visa interview at Karachi Consulate (1st by Chinese VO, 2nd by 1st counter American with slightly bald personality).
I have 100% scholarship from the university for my masters. I've applied to only one school though. 
Should I apply for the third time with the same profile or leave it?
I'm just concerned that I don't want to change my university, but what should I say when the VO will ask ""What Circumstances Have You Changed This Time?"".
"

Embassy: Islamabad 
Status: rejected
VO: Good morning
Me: Good morning 
VO: 
(after passing documents and after scanning fingers) why are you going to US
Me: I'm going to study masters in computer science from Maharishi international university
VO: Why this university
Me: I have chosen this university because it's offering the courses that I was looking for. I'm working as a consultant and I have to get expertise in (mentioned 4 subjects). These fields are very important for my consultancy position and MIU is offering courses related to all these subjects.
VO: Do you have any travel history
Me: No sir
VO: Who's sponsoring you
Me: My sister
VO: I can't give you visa, reason is mentioned on this slip.
Question1: What could be the possible reason for rejection? 
Question2: I applied for November intake. Should I try again or wait for February intake?
Question 3: should I add my current employer as my sponsor (they are willing to sponsor me). Would that be a plus? I'm afraid it will make my case suspicious that why your company wasn't sponsoring you before.

Hi guys, My visa was refused on 31 Jan the worst day of my life. I was not expecting that I was sure that I am a genuine student and that my profile is so strong my visa will not be refused but it is. I went into depression and couldn't even talk to my parents for a few days then I decided I am not gonna try again. I should switch to Australia and apply there. And I was scared that maybe my Australian visa will be refused because my USA visa is refused. I contacted many 
consultants they said It's not a big deal. I asked a few questions in this group and came to know that it's not a big deal many students got visas on the second attempt. So I gathered information from everyone and came to the point I should try again for the USA. because if my Australian visa is refused there will be no chance that my USA visa will be approved. So I defer my semester to fall 2023. So I want to know from you guys What I should change to my application?
Should I change university? All other students who applied to that uni got visa approval, not even a single one got a refusal.
Should I add another sponsor along with my father?
Those guys who got approval after rejection please tell me what you guys did.
Lastly, I want to tell you to say your interview did not go well which may be the reason. But my interview lasted for 15 minutes and I answered everything. But when I posted my experience in this group I realized that I made 1 to 2 mistakes but that's not a reason for refusal.

Hello everyone
One of my friend and me appeared in islamabad consulate on 14 April with regular appointment instead of previously refused.No one questioned us on this and we saw no.of students with regular but i have seen a post in this group a student got refused by karachi consulate because of using regular appointment.
I don’t think officer have any problem with your appointment category and give refusal on the basis of appointment category because they don’t know about this 
and they never asked for appointment confirmation slip on interview counter.
Anyone here who used regular appointment in karachi consulate without any problem instead of previously refused?

3rd Interview for F-1

When 
I reached to visa officer, she scanned my passport and said Oh! You applied twice in December 2022? 
Me: Yes, 
VO: okay, what did you change in your profile/application? 
Me: I changed my way of confidence and i am prepared this time for Interview. In my last 2 visa interviews I was not much confident and did not deliver the satisfactory answers and spoiled the whole interview session. 
VO: what universities did you applied and why you applied only in those universities and why you chose this university. Me: told the universities names where I applied, and told her When I was searching on internet the best university in the US for MS Marketing with concentration of Data mining USF was on the top of the list then I researched more about the university and found out it is alligned with what I was looking for!! 
VO: why this course? Me: allow me few minutes elaborate my whole situation, as you can see in my DS160 my previous education is engineering, when I joined the company where I am currently employed I got a chance to work with their marketing and I found my hidden skills of marketing. After working and more with the marketing team my interest in this field increased but I observed myself there are still some gaps which needs to be filled and this course will help me to fill those gaps. During the session the VO was countinuously reading what was written on her computer screen instead of typing, I think she was reading notes dropped by previous visa officers on my application. 
VO: sorry, you can not qualify for US visa because you did not change anything in your profile/application.
Me: what do I need to change? 
VO: you have to change your application
Me: Okay, thanks. I left the counter.

I am sharing my profile and f-1 visa interview experience which is refused. Kindly tell me what mistakes I made and what should i do.
Profile.
MS in mathematics from NUST I was admitted to Ph.D. mathematics at a fully funded scholarship at RPI.
Interview experience.
VO: Good morning pass me your i-20 and passport.
Me. 
Good morning. yes sure
VO. Why do you want to get higher studies?
Me. Well, my father is a teacher and he teaches me basic mathematics in my school. He developed my interest in mathematics and support me in my higher studies. I got a silver medal in MSc and also did my MS from a top-ranked university in Pakistan. And now I want to be a professor after getting Ph.D.
VO. What are you doing since your last degree? (I didn't understand what he said and didn't ask VO to repeat the question).
Me. (I didn't remember what I answered.)
VO. What are you doing now?
Me. I have been teaching in a higher secondary school since April 2019.
VO. Have you visited the US before?
Me. No, I haven't.
VO. Why you are not doing PhD in Pakistan?
Me. I completed my master's from NUST Islamabad which is a top-ranked university in Pakistan. So I don't have a better option after getting MS from NUST. I have received offers from different countries but all of those offers were without funding. During this time I got an opportunity to study in the US with funding, and I accepted this offer.
VO. I can not issue a visa this time. Thank you.
During the interview, VO looks at my i-20 almost 4 times.
(I prepared my interview well. But didn't answer a single question I prepared. I don't know what happened at that time.)

Hello guys! Need help to decide this. My previous 2 visas were refused for Purdue University MSBA at Islamabad Embassy. From interviews, I gathered that my financials were the apparent reason for refusal since I have a student loan. 
I am working on showing complete balance in the bank statement for third attempt. I have an I-20 from Southern Methodist University MSBA with a good amount of scholarship. 
1. 
Should I change my university in the next attempt and would it be a problem since SMU is a downgrade from Purdue? 
2. Would it help at all if I choose Karachi for the next interview? 
3. Can people get in touch or comment who got their F1 visa in 3rd or 4th attempt? Any tips?

Me: Because I wanted to explore the market of embedded system so that later in pakistan i can have a great business out of it. When i did research , i  figured out that US is on the top of list and has a great embedded system market  then i thought what can be better than this studying within USA. So I chose USA for my study.

VO: How many universities did you apply to?
Me: I applied to four universities 
VO: And which universities?
Me: I applied to North Eastern, Dayton, Texas Tech and IIT.

Me: No, i also got admission from Dayton but for computer science not for Electrical engineering program that i wanted to do, yet  they have not told me their decision for my application of electrical engineering.
VO: Then why not Dayton? (in loud voice with reactive face )
Me: Because I wanted to do masters in electrical engineering with specialization in embedded system and yet they have not told me their decision for my application of electrical engineering so that's why I chose IIT.

Is there anyone who got a rejection after Administrative Processing (221g)? Will they notify by email that your visa is rejected?
I have given interview in Karachi Consulate on April 28, 2022 and since then status was ""Refused"" and the date stated of last update was April 28, 2022 but today I checked again and it still says ""Refused"" but date of last updated changed to July 14, 2022. I got no email.

Location: Ankara 
Status: Alhamdulilah Approved 
Interview:
Note: I had a prior refusal 6 months ago, it was my second time.
Officer: Why do you wanna go to USA?
Me: Well officer I want to go to pursue my bachelors degree in business administration, I applied for two universities and got accepted from both of them plus received scholarship. But the reason I chooses this degree, my uncle graduated from the same degree from uk now he is working in United Nations as regional administrator. I basically want to follow his career path.
Officer: ok who is sponsoring you?
Well first I received a scholarship from the university and my parents are doctors we have private clinic and private pharmacy additionally we have XYZ amount of property. Beside if necessary my uncle is also sponsoring me so I have a very stable financial situation.
Officer: do you have any relatives in us.
Me: no 
Officer: you sure any cousin?

Why your family don’t wanna go to the USA.

Please approve. As this was approved earlier but the topic of degree was diff.
 Thank you.
Assalam-u-Alaikum 
Greetings Everyone. 
Any 
kind of help would be truly appreciated.
Profile:- 
1) 2.59 GPA Reason for low is that I never knew min 3 will be required and no one was there to guide . 
2) Took IELTS academic back in 2020 scored 7.0 overall
3) More than 5 + years of experience in relevant field in top tier organisations locally and international. After this extensive period in the industry, I want to pursue masters as It would open doors for me in my professional growth. 
4) Undergrad Major = Computer science 
5) certification = data analytics , digital marketing , sql and other related 
Can somebody please guide me of the universities that I eligible for, I have a list of universities that are accepting 2.5 -2.7GPA but when i went to some of the university websites, they are preferring more than the mentioned. 
I also have an offer letter of Western New England and Mercy college NY but the course fee of thee ranges 3500-3800$. So it will be really hard for me to earn this much of amount. 
Also my budget is in the range of 25-30 lac for the first semester. And after that need to earn it on my own.
Can someone help me in find the university where I can pay my fee and can help me get a visa in the discipline of data analytics, business analytics, big data, data science or realted ones ?
Also are there any members who had a similar case like mine and that they were able to succeed in this journey. 
Thank you so much in advance for the help. JazakAllah o khair

VO: Wellcome to the state. Your passport will be delivered to you in 2 to 4 business days.
These questions are so simple but in a way its more difficult for those students who are feeling hesitation in front of visa officer.
So the thing all students have to do is Just be confident and look in the eyes of the visa officer. Don’t lie about anything, they already have your background data and talk to them what they ask in simple words. 
Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence
Special thanks to sir junaid, group admin and all members who are helping everyone.

VISA EXPERIENCE 
VISA APPROVED,ALLHAMDULLILAH
21July'22 9:00am ( hardly 5 mints interview)
Visa officer -chinese looking guy( Karachi embassy)
Vo : good morning 
Me: 
hello good morning Vo
Vo: please put your fingers on scanner, pressed tightly the pinky finger ( in a laughing way)
Me: does as told
Vo: oh I see you are working in a bank?
Me: yes I work in a local bank of Pakistan as Trainer / quality assurance executive in customer satisfaction and quality department. I train freshly hired officer (said a bit proudly:p)
Vo: why are you going to USA?
Me: i am going to USA for pursuing my MBA in marketing from New Mexico Highland University,  lasvegas 
Vo: How did you get to know about this university?
Me: my previous university professor recommended me this uni as he was an alumni of nmhu. Beside this I searched this university through different website like us news, niche and master portal.
Vo: you have such a stable job, why you want to leave it ?
Me: after becoming Trainer I didn't thought to go for masters degree because I was already achieving my goals step by step. But recently I got rejected for a managerial post in my company with a reason that I am not holding a masters degree and( as this was eligibility criteria for managerial post) this thing hit me harder and then I decided to apply for Mba. ( tbh it's a true story)
Vo: oh i see, after looking at my I 20 meticulously he said, oh who is xyz( my sponsor's name)
Me: he is my uncle who live in USA and is a US citizen 
Vo: what he do for living?
Me: He owns an It company named as xyz. This company is in over 240+ location but he owns the Santonio location.
Vo: will you ask you employer for leaves or you will resign ?
Me: I have discussed this with my head of department, they are talking with HR let's see what they will suggest. You know every firm has it on policy. Even if the don't approve my sabbatical leaves I'll resign and rejoin after completing my MBA. I know I  will get the job with my acquaintance and credibility 
Vo: congratulations you VISA is approved. 
*Posting this for encouraging all those people who are scared of several things. My case my pretty critical, chances of rejection was high because of primarily two reasons:
1. My brother lives in USA currently he recently got graduated from Louisiana state university and is in opt right now( vo didn't even asked about him)
2. Secondly my sponsor was my mother's cousin who is a US citizen.
But that's not a big thing if your are confident and sound genuine, means your story should sound real not made up. The most important thing is your  faith in Allah. If you say that I have strong faith but stillyou feel scared and week then your beliefs are not strong. I would like to thanks 
Rana Ibrar
  who helped me to articulate my answers , encouraged and motivated me for acing this interview. I couldn't achieved this without his help.

ADMIN URGENT APPROVAL, SINCE I ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL HELPFUL INFO. 
By the grace of Almighty Allah Visa Status: Approved
Type: F1
Time and date: 8:45 am, 22nd May 2023
Embassy: Karachi
VO: An American lady
VO: Good Morning
Me: Good Morning. How are you, ma'am?
VO: Fine, thank you! 
VO: So, why are you going to Georgia State University.
Me: To pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science
VO: Who will sponsor your studies?
Me: Told
VO: What does he do?
Me: Told
VO: Show me your sponsor's statement of account:
Me: Handed it over.
VO: Have you previously applied for a US visa? (looking at my previous record)
Me: No (My parents applied for a US visit a few years ago when I was not old enough to know what was going on, so I couldn't recall it the first time she asked about it).
VO: Are you sure? (Looks at me sideways)
Me: (Then it finally occurred to me that, yeah, my parents had applied for a visa back in the day. I clarified that I was young, so that's why I couldn't recall it. VO laughs it off)
VO: Okay, then, I am approving your visa, and make sure to collect your passport in 2 to 3 days.
Me: Was overwhelmed with emotions and in utter disbelief.
My take: The interview itself lasted hardly 45 seconds. I would say that my sponsor (I'd mind disclosing my sponsor) was the sole reason for my approval. The VO did not ask any other major or college-related questions apart from what was asked above. Also, given my interview experience and what was happening inside the interview room, VOs do not reject you out of rudeness or some other baseless reason. Neither you have met the interviewers nor the interviews have met you. It all comes down to how you present yourself and how genuine of a student you are. Anyway, enough of my Ted talk. 
Thank you, Almighty Allah, my parents, and the countless members of Pakistani Student in USA, who were willing to share their interview experiences regardless of their outcome.
Thank you once again!
Edit:
An important thing I did not mention: I qualified for an out-of-state waiver at the college. Essentially, I've been waived off out-of-state tuition and will pay in-state tuition, tuition paid by a Georgian resident that is far cheaper than out-of-state tuition.
So, for those looking to apply to GSU, the university will automatically consider your application for this waiver, and you have better chances to qualify for one if you submit your apps in early September or as soon as applications open.
The waiver goes by the name of Campus Atlanta Scholarship, which
includes either a 50% or a 100% waiver.
Peace

INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE 
Embassy islamabad 
VO was a long beard American Guy
Date: Dec 7 2022
Status: Approved 
PROFILE: 
Intermediate in Accounts
In 2019. 
Minnesota state university Mankato. 
Duolingo 120.
Slot 10 Am.

Interview was scheduled at 9 00 but took place around 12 pm. 
VO asked me the following questions:

University of California, Davis
2- Why this university? 
There are multiple reasons
A) Its a very good research school.

4 - Her expression changed upon hearing the word automate, and she stopped typing and said , by automate you mean like AI? 
No, we will be doing it through graphs and different tools, we will be mainly working on rust (a new programming language). (She didn't understand the technical terms but said ohh okay).
{I also had my advisor wrote me a letter stating the research I will be doing , so I told her I also have a letter from my supervisor which states my research, but she said I don't need it).
5- where did you do your undergrad from?
Lahore university of management sciences.
6- do you have a masters degree?
No, I am going after my undergrad, it's a masters leading to a PhD program.
7- what does your father do.
Told he is retired. (I expected the next answer would be about expenses , so I told her my program is fully funded and here's the funding letter - I tried passing her the letter to which she said, yes, I can see that on your I 20.)
8- what are your future plans?
I plan to work in academia. I would like to come back to Pakistan and join my undergrad institute as an Associate professor, a PhD is a a minimum requirement for that - I really enjoy teaching and I worked as teaching assistant for 5 courses during my undergrad - pointed towards my resume as well.
VO started typing and scrolling for like a minute.
9- Do you have any relatives in the US?
No.
She scrolled and type for like 30ish seconds and passed me the blue slip.
Just keep it simple, and causal. Be confident. Take it as a conversation not an interview. Be yourself. 
Best of luck, you got this.

Congrats, I am approving your visa! 
I was shocked at what is happening...
VO already rejected 4 students in front of me after a full detailed interview..
And I want to tell you one thing interesting ... I was in the line where VO was a lady and she was rejecting everyone and rejecting 4,5 students already...When she calls me for an interview I skipped the line...Their security officer asked me why I skip the line?. I said I feel hesitant in front of the lady officer 
...He said okayy and allow me to give my interview to the male Visa officer..
It was quick barely 2 minutes. I was prepared and confident enough. 
Serious suggestion:- Be confident with a smiling face and don't hesitate... VO wants to give VISA if you are confident...
Thanks...

2:- Go early, my interview was at 9 30 and I went in at 9 o clock and got into the embassy at 12. 
3:- Get atleast 2 copies of Confirmation letter and your Id card because they take those  before the shuttle service. And if you don’t have these you need to get into the line for photocopy and thats an additional 30 minutes. 
4:- The only options for the shuttle service was 3000 and 5000, and the lady said that I needed to take the premium service because I was getting late.
They try to sell the premium service but it not necessary at all because there is another line outside the embassy. 
5:- Don’t worry about the time , My appointment was scheduled for 9 30 and I was interviewed at 12 15 . 
6:- I had done a mock interview with my college counselor and read a couple of interviews in the group . I read the frequently asked questions mentioned in the post of a Mod. 
Allah Khair krsi.
I’m not an expert but if anybody needs any kind of help feel free to ask .

Visa interview experiences
Here is the detailed post for all of my interview experiences from 2017 to 2021. 
It 
is going to be a long post so please bear the headache in your stomach while reading. However, I will try to make it short. 
So it all started when I completed my intermediate(HSSC) from Pakistan. I did my IELTS and applied through a consultant at Wichita state university. My score in IELTS was not that good also, I secured admission in a pathway program.  
1st interview experience.
Embassy: Islamabad
University: Wichita state university. 
Course: Pathway+ bachelors in Aerospace engineering. 
Date: I don't remember the exact date but I think it was on the 4th of Feb 2017. 
Vo: Good morning
Me: Good morning mam. How are u?
Vo: Give me ur documents
Me: Handed over my documents to her. 
Vo: Why are you going to us?
Me: I am going to pursue my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering.
Vo: Which uni?
Me: Wichita state uni
Vo: Why this uni?
Me: Told about uni curriculum, professor's research, etc.
Vo: How many unis u have applied to?
Me: 3 and named them.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: Father
Vo: What does your sponsor do?
Me: Told about my father's govt job and rental shops that we own.
Vo: Give me your bank statement?
Me: Gave her
Vo: Educational documents as well..
Me: I handed over all the documents to her. 
Vo took my passport i20 along with those documents which were asked ...
Ok, I am giving you this white sheet for processing ur documents..  means 221(g).
My case was transferred into the administration process where they verify documents I think. I was really happy as 90+% 221g cases are approved. When I left the embassy and check the online status, it was saying refused. I was stunned that how it could be possible that after one hour of my interview, they refused me. Anyhow, after a few days, I got an email to pick up your documents from .... location, I picked up my documents along with 214B sheet. It was really unfair to me as everything was genuine and still, they rejected me.. 
I thought to apply again as I wasn't aware of the reason for rejection. 
2nd interview experience.
Embassy: ISL
University: I applied with the same university and with the same course as it was in my first interview.
Date: It was in March 2017
The visa officer just asked 3 questions.
VO: Which uni?

The Visa officer handed over me 214b and said I cannot approve your visa, I left the embassy without saying anything.
3rd interview experience.

Vo. Another question was in urdu but I can't remember.
After looking at me he gave me yellow slip n me apko abi viisa nai de sakta but ap or counsler se try kr skty hain agr ap mutafik hain..
After getting 3 rejections, I thought to apply to more universities and I got accepted into 5-6 universities this time. I selected Indiana tech university as I was having a good amount of scholarships. 
4th attempt.
Embassy: ISL
University; Indiana institute of technology with $13000 scholarship.
Course: Bs mechanical engineering without any pathway.
Date: August 2017.
Intake: Fall.
VO: which uni?

Me: I said, I did intermediate here in Pak but not engineering. 
Vo: which program?
Me: bs mechanical eng.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father is sponsoring me along with this I have secured a 13000$ scholarship from that uni,
Vo: what does your father do?

Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is written in this paper(214B).
After getting a rejection, I thought to apply again for the Spring intake. 
5th attempt.
Embassy: ISL.
University: Same as it was in 4th attempt.
Date: 31 November 2017
Intake: Spring.

Vo: no thanks,

Me: Father 
Vo: What does he do?
Me: same as I used to speak for my sponsor in previous interviews.
Vo: I cannot approve your visa. 
Me: Thanks.
It was my fifth attempt and had wasted almost two years for the same. I can apply for Australia or Uk at that time, my brain was saying to apply in other countries and my heart was like no no you should go to the USA as it has been my biggest wish to get a USA visa and study over there. 
Anyways, I decided to complete my bachelor's here in Pakistan and apply again for my master's study in the states. 
I completed my bachelor's degree in October 2020 with a 3.7 CGPA.
I took the Duolingo test(alternate of IELTS due to Covid days) and scored 130. Right after completing my bachelor's, I applied to 4 universities with the help of Asim Sahab(my career counselor) Depaul University, Saint Louis University, Oregon state university, and I got accepted in all of them with partial scholarships for spring intake 2021. 
After getting admits, I thought why not apply to some well-ranked university. I dropped off my plans for Spring intake 2021 and applied to Northeastern University(Ranked under top 50 universities nationally according to US News ranking) by myself with the help of Zaryab(A great friend of mine). I got admit from it for the fall intake 2021.
After getting i20, I applied for an appointment from US embassy ISL. I got an appointment for 13th July. 
6th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 13/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
It took almost 1 hour I believe by going through the routine process from shuttle service to embassy.
I wasn't aware of that bald guy who was famous for rejections. Unfortunately, I had to give my interview to the same VO. He rejected a student before me.
Me: Good morning.
VO: No reply.
Vo: Can you pass me your documents?
Me: Sure.
Vo: Let's take fingerprints first. 
Me: I did the same and asked if it is done?
Vo: Yeah.
Me: Cool.
Vo: Why are you going to the US?
Me: I am going to us to pursue my master's in project management from Northeastern University, Boston. 
Vo: Why did you choose this school?
Me: I asked him to repeat the question as his voice was not clear.
Vo: He repeated the question.
Me: Besides its ranking that comes under the top 50 schools nationally according to US news ranking I choose NEU due to its course curriculum that offers different electives, workshops and a capstone project,  (Vo interrupted me)
Vo: Who is paying for your trip?
Me: Father.
Vo: What does he do?
Me: I was explaining about my father job and business( He interrupted again)
Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is mentioned in this paper(yellow sheet, here he handed me two yellow sheets, I was like o bhai mere pas dher laga huwa yellow sheets ka already 
 )
Me; thanks and left the embassy with a shattered heart as I was really prepared for this attempt and made many changes in my profile this time. Anyhow, I decided to reapply as It seems unfair to me without knowing the reason he rejected me even he was not listening to my answers. 
I did not bother to change anything in my profile as I did not exactly know the reason for rejection. 
7th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 30/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
Before me, one student visa got approved who got rejected previously and the visa officer asked him what changes he made in his profile he said no changes as he was not confident last time and now he is. He got his visa approved. 
after that student officer asked me to move forward.
Me: good morning how are you doing?
Vo: He said good thank you,
Vo: I see you have been refused already so what changes do you bring out this time?
Me: I don’t feel to make any changes in my profile since I have gotten admission to a highly ranked university in USA with a course curriculum that is perfectly aligned with my future plans of Pakistan, 
After listening to that he was continuously seeing his computer screen, I guess he must be checking my previous interview experiences,
After a few minutes, he told me I cannot approve your visa the reason is the same as before, 
I said is it permanent rejection as this is my 7th attempt, 
He said, you have too many rejections and you need to change the circumstances. 
I left the counter.
I thought to change my sponsor and added my mother as my sponsor in my DS160. I thought to try changing sponsor so maybe it could work. 
8th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 11/08/2021 / 10:15 Am
VO was a big beard guy with his 50-55. 
Me: Hi sir, how are you doing?
VO: good morning, can you please scan your fingerprints.
I did, then VO told me to pass my documents. 
VO: what is the purpose of your trip?
Me: I am going to us to pursue master's in project management from northeastern uni, Boston.
VO: who will bear the expenses?
Me: My parents.
VO: What do they do?
Told about the parent business and job. In the end I said, we have a savings of 52k$. Do you want to see the bank statement?
VO: no, not needed.
VO: Have you ever visited any country?
Me: No, I never visited any country.
VO: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Me: Yes I do have.
VO: what do they do?
Me: One of my brothers is a chemical engineer and working as senior chemical eng in service industries, other siblings are still studying.
Then he started typing and after 30-45 seconds he said, Us laws are really strict and I cannot approve your visa.
I said, sir, is there anything wrong with my profile as this is my 8th attempt for f1 visa? 
VO: there is nothing wrong with your profile and you did not change anything in your profile.
I said I have changed my sponsor this time as I added my mother to my sponsor list.
VO: sorry.
I said thank you and left the counter.
After this attempt, I decided to change my university and reapply again.  I was also thinking to change the embassy but dropped off this plan as in my point of view embassy does not matter at all. 
I deferred my admission to Depaul university to spring intake 2022 and applied for the i20. I got an electronic i20 at the end of august and paid the fee again for the appointment.
9th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Depaul University, Chicago
Course: Master of Science in business analytics ($6k scholarship)
Intake: Spring 2022
Status: Approved
Date&time: 17/09/2021 / 8:00 Am
Vo was a really great guy in his 50+. Before me, the visa of one girl got approved. Luckily, I did not see the bald guy there and there were two VO's that were taking the interviews. I observed they were approving visas for most of the candidates. I was the last one being interviewed in the embassy. My visa interviews went smoothly. 
Me: Good morning officer, how are you doing?
Vo: Hi, good.
Vo: Fingerprints, I said is it done? , he said yeah. 
Vo: So, Mr.... you were there before uhmm..... He scanned my DS160.
Me: Yes, my visa has been refused 3 times this year. I want to say something. Actually, last time visa officer told me to change something in my profile and reapply. Now, I have changed my university with a more popular and advanced STEM degree that has a promising career in Pakistan. My intentions are to get my master's degree from the USA and come back to Pakistan to work as a business analyst in one of my dream companies that is Nestle. 
Vo: hmmm...
Vo: He was seeing the previous visa officer's comments on his screen, he got up and went back to talk with someone, I guess he was speaking about the visa officer who had rejected me before. He made some funny comments with his colleague and smiling.
Vo: So, you have applied to this embassy?
Me: Yes, I have applied to the ISL embassy. 
Vo: Have you ever applied to the KHI embassy?
Me: No, never. 
Vo: He scanned my ds160 3-4 times. I don't know why. He then wrote down his comments. After some time, Ok Mr.... you are good to go, your visa has been approved and you will get your passport within 5 days. He returned back i20, ds160, blue sheet(Approval sheet) and put my passport in the basket.
Me; Thanks, officer, thank you so much. 
Vo: Have a nice stay in the states while smiling. 
Me: Inside me( yeah yeah buddy why not).
I was literally crying when I was leaving the embassy, it was like a dream come true for me. 
I would like to thanks a few members of this group who helped me a lot during my interview experiences.

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Status: Approved, received passport in three days.
Date: April 13, 2022
Consulate/Embassy: Islamabad.
Major and University: Bachelor’s in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts Amherst.
My interview was scheduled for 11 AM, but I got to the Embassy at around 8 AM and the guards allowed me to enter early. I was out of the embassy by 9:15-ish. The interview itself only lasted 3 minutes.
I was asked the following questions:
1: What’s your major.
2: Why did you choose this university.
3: How many did you apply to.
4: Show me your scholarship letter.
5: What does your father do.
6: How much land does your father own.
7: Has he ever travelled outside Pakistan.
8: Have you travelled outside Pakistan in the last five years.
9: What do you intend to do after the degree.
The only thing the VO saw was my admissions letter with scholarship (14,000 USD per year, and funding from my father is 45,000 USD).
There are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about the Visa process here.
If you can:
1: Establish yourself as a genuine student;
2: Show concrete proof of funding;
3: Convince the VO you will return to Pakistan,
You will NEVER be denied the Visa.
1: Establishing yourself as a genuine student:
One of the best — or maybe the only way — to convince the VO that you’re a genuine student is to apply and get accepted to top public or private universities. I applied to 16 public colleges (all top 100 for my major) and I was accepted to 13, Alhumdulillah. There is no such thing as a “visa ratio”; as long as your university is highly ranked for your major, and is selective, you’ll get the visa.
My advice: Please do not hire consultants to apply to universities on your behalf. They only have very low ranking universities that will negatively impact your chances of getting a Visa.
2: Proof of funding:
It’s very important to convince the VO that you/your sponsor can fund at least a full year of living and tuition in the States. My VO did not even ask to see my bank statements, and that was probably because I told her what my father did, and that I had received more scholarships from other universities but ultimately chose UMass because it had a better ranked program — UMass did not offer me the highest scholarship from my list. This convinced the VO that my father can, indeed, fund my stay in the States.
3: Strong ties to home country:
Convince the VO that your entire family is in Pakistan and — if your father owns a business — tell them that you’ll inherit the business. This is usually ample proof.
Also, English speaking skills and confidence go a LONG way. I believe my interview was so short because I was speaking English very naturally and confidently. Which may be why the VO did not even ask for more documents.
I understand that a lot of applicants may not be able to speak English fluently, and I would strongly advise them to invest in English speaking classes at least three months before the interview. If you’re not going for a language program, it’s imperative to have a strong grip on English.

Me: told
Vo: To How many universities you have applied?

The 96% faculty of this university is highly qualified in their respective fields. And this university is providing me all these facilities at a very affordable tuition fees

Me: after completing graduation from USA I will come back to Pakistan and here I will establish my own agriculture farm.

Vo: from where you will get money to establish Agriculture farm?
Me: my father have 52 Acers of Agricultural land. And these are enough for establishing an agriculture farm.
Vo:Why you have chosen this field?

VISA APPROVED
Date: 19thMay 2023
Program: PhD in Engineering Education (Fully funded)
University: State University of New York at Buffalo
location: US Embassy Islamabad
VO 
was a middle aged lady with glasses
Me: Good Morning Officer (Meanwhile I had already passed my passport, I 20, SEVIS and DS-160)
VO: Good Morning. Is it your first time here?
Me: Yes, I have never been here before.
VO: So where are you going?
Me:  I plan to go to SUNY Buffalo for my PhD in Engineering Education and it is a fully funded offer with an assistantship.
VO: How did you come to know about this PhD?
Me: Well the desire to do my PhD in this field stemmed from my surroundings. Throughout my educational and professional career, I noticed that Engineering is considered to be male dominant field. Somewhere deep down I wanted to change that and for this exact reason I plan to do my research in “Diversity and inclusion in Engineering education”.  (I was not interrupted at all by VO so I kept on talking). Although PhD in this field is being offered by other US universities as well but I chose this university cuz I had read a few research papers of Prof xyz so I dropped  her an email expressing my interest to work with her to which she replied then we had a zoom a session and she agreed to supervise me provided I can get myself admitted by meeting the requirements of graduate school. I then applied at uni portal and not only did I get admitted but I was also offered a full scholarship.
That was a long answer but I just did not wanna stop until I was interrupted so I kept going.
VO:  So you have assistantship?
Me: Yes I do have it.
VO: So what exactly would you do in your research?
Me: There would basically be 3 major research questions and then went on to state all 3 of them.
VO: Tell me how as a male you came to realize the underrepresentation of women in engineering?
Till now, VO would ask me a question and then would start typing on the computer and would occasionally make an eye contact. But after asking this question, she took both her hands off keyboard and placed on the table as if she was very eager to listen to my answer.
Me:  When I was doing my bachelors, there were only 2 girls in a class of 50 people. During the fours years of my professional career, there was only a handful of representation of female members of the society and even those who were there, they would put in a resign after sometime. So I always had it in back of my hand that if we are not taking measures to make our educational institutes diverse and inclusive then we would have to bear severe economical repercussions.
VO: Do you have bachelor's in STEM?
Me: Yes, I did my bachelor's in electronics engineering.
VO: Which school would you be joining in UB?
Me: School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
VO kept typing for few seconds and then out came the golden words. Your visa is approved and she handed me over the blue slip.
Well in my view giving confident answers by maintaining  eye contact with the VO does make a massive difference. VO did not ask for anything from me not even my own CV. The other thing is being proactive in the interview can pass you off as someone who knows what he is doing.

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Embassy: Islamabad
Status : Approved
Applied by myself
After greeting, VO said my name and I nodded in response
Why are you going to US
I'm going for studies
You're going to Harvard. Great. What are you going to study?
Differential equations
Differential equations?
Yes, my concentration is differential equations although it says liberal arts on the document.
Why do you want to study these?
I'm a teacher and need to learn them so I can teach it to my students.
How was the application process?
(VO was asking about admission application and I thought he meant visa application) Most people said I should get an advisor or counsellor but I did it myself, didn't find it very complicated.
(VO interrupted) 
Did you apply and get accepted for it or just signed up?
I had to apply and go through the admission process.
OK. How do you plan to pay for it?
From my savings.
How much  do you have?
I shared the amount.
Are you married?
Yes
Any kids?
No.
Is your wife going with you?
No she's not. (I wanted to explain why, but didn't)
Have you changed your name before?
No, I haven't.
OK. It says you were Akmal (not real name) before?
My family calls me that endearly. It hasn't been my official name. 
OK I'm approving your visa. You'll get your passport in some days.
I asked how long it will take and he said its on the blue slip.
VO kept typing throughtout these questions and there were long pauses between questions. He didn't ask me for any supporting documents apart from the usual sevis fee, visa fee, DS 160 and Passport.
I was very nervous because he refused 3 people before me and only one approval. At the last minute I told myself that this person is a gatekeeper and I have to go to US nomatterwhat. I focused on why I was there and where I wanted to be, instead of focusing on people around me. Confidence is key. He could have refused me for my ans to last question but I clarified and was confident which I think helped.
ایسا لگ رہا ہے جیسے برسوں کا بوجھ ہٹ گیا ہو۔ 
I was refused visa for UK 4 years ago despite having an offer from University of Cambridge and it took me 3 years to save the money for this program.
I'd like to thank Tahir Haneef for helping me clear my doubts and for questions I had. I'd also like to thank you all for this group and the moderators. I did multiple mock interviews using different questions from previous posts here.
BTW nobody tells you about the whole gruesome process of going to shuttle stop, the exorbitant fee for it, multiple queues and security checks. The embassy building is daunting. Also, from the moment I stepped out of embassy to until I left the shuttle stop, every person I met asked me for mithayi after seeing the blue slip. I hope our workers learn some self respect and stop the begging.

I finally received a visa after 40 days of administrative processing.
University: Cleveland State University
Sponsor: Cousin living in the US
Embassy: Islamabad
Interview date: 03 Aug 2022
Passport received: 20 Sep 2022
Interview experience: VO only asked about my program and current job while constantly typing. He was not asking anything else but just typing, I was telling him about my graduation, sponsor and future goals. He was just saying OK in reply. He then told me he will need some more information via email and returned my passport.
So, i want to share my experience what observed so far, it might be helpful for someone.
First and the most important thing is the believe in Allah and Duas from parents.
Practice interview in front of a mirror or laptop camera.
Prepare the answers to common questions from VO and analyze them until you get confidence that they are according to your case because only you know the best about yourself. Tell him like a story and show your accomplishments. No doubt, university and sponsorship matter but the most important thing that matters is how you are presenting your case if it makes sense then all OK. Your whole profile matter.
One last important thing which we often ignore, please be dressed as it depicts how serious you are about your study or the concerned post. They judge you from the very moment when you get up from the chair and move towards the window.
Best of luck all.
Thanks!

The Officer was Long beard Guy.
Indiana Institute of Tech
The interview was pretty quick and straightforward.
Who is your sponsor?
Father's business?
How many branches?
How many Employees?
Why Gap?
Have you been to the U.S before?
Is it an Online Institution?
That was about it I guess If I remember correctly. I just wanted to post here because I used to read people's stories and get inspired to an extent so I thought it was my obligation to do the same.
There are no tricks Guys. Just know your stuff.
Read as much as possible about your course, your university, your Gap if any, and your sponsor's business (how many employees, the total income etc). The more you read about your stuff the more confident you will be.
Just be confident, be fluent. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's going to a 2-3 minutes interview that will change your life. 
One more thing, don't think about 2nd attempt. Consider your first attempt the last one and get the visa.
Good Luck!

Hello there! 
My visa was rejected twice in 2021(transfer student) when i was still in 5th semester of my University doing bachelors. Now I've completed my undergrad in 2022 and have an year experience with Toyota in my field. 
Should I reapply for MS/MBA. Seeing that I wasn't granted visa two times, will the VO make sure i don't get it third time? 
I have property and apartments on my name. I run a business too and have a full time job. 
Need 
some guidance, Kindly. 
I'm highly confused. 
Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

Interview date = 11 Aug
Location = Karachi consulate 
Status = rejected 
V.O= young Chinese man
Time slot = 9.00 am
University = NYIT, Manhattan campus
Scanned passport and fingerprints
VO started looking at computer and then looked at me. He repeatedly did that  3 to 4 times. Then he asked 2 questions only. 
First Question = Why did you apply to this course? 
Answer = I have previously done BBA and now I'm planning to do MBA in order to polish my skills and expand my father's business in the global market. 
2nd = How did you find this university? 
Ans= I had previously done BBA from Lahore and now wish to study abroad for a global mindset, specially in a metropolitan city. So I searched for MBA program on Masters portal amd filtered my search for New York. (VO said Ok). I found a bunch of high ranked universities and then studied their ranking and course structure (VO said Ok as if it was enough) and this university matched my requirements. (Again Ok). Also,... (I was speaking in my flow but I realized that he had basically stopped me at this point. So I said Ok and stopped).
He asked me to go back and sit.
After some time I was taken into a seperate room where a Pakistani consular came and talked to me in Urdu.
I greeted him and he straight forward started like consider this a chance for yourself. I kept on agreeing with a smily face until he asked me which consultant did you use? I disagreed and told him that I had done everything by myself. However,  I have seeked some help from a friend as in discussions but nothing else. He continued this interogation for quite some time but my answers remained the same. He told me that I had matching profile with a lot of other candidates and that he has been dealing with them regularly. In fact, a lot of stidents with the same profile had come earlier and agreed that they used a consultant. I told him that a friend of mine has also come here with me and we have discussed things together if that is what you are looking for. But he remained insisting that there were many and that they've agreed to a consultant. I never agreed and he let me out and after some time, I got my passport back with white slip(214B).rejected.
Previously, my friend (whose appointment was at 8 15) was also interogated but for a longer duration than me. He claims that they showed him the exact location of the consultancy on computer screen. This did not happen with me nor he showed any other proof.
Also, I'd like some suggestions if I should go again with the same profile or change university and then apply for the next intake (January)? I'd really like to go in this intake but not sure if I'll be rejected again since I can't change my uni at this point!

Greetings and handed over my documents 
VO: Which course are you going for? 
I am 
going for masters in Computer Science 
VO: Why have you chosen RU? 
I have picked it due to a number of reasons, It was recommended to me by my Company's Director MR XYZ as he was their Alumni and he spoke very highly of them. I have also worked with one of their faculty members in computer science for my final year project for data training and AI models. The course structure aligns perfectly with my area of interest and are the advanced subjects that I have studied in my undergrad, so these all reasons made it an ideal choice. 
VO: Did you apply to any other university? 
Yes I applied to 6 universities and got the offers from 3 of them including RU. 
V0: What are you currently doing? 
I am working as a Program manager in a fintech company, name XYZ. Its a good place but my growth has halted and for that reason I am going for a masters degree from abroad. 
VO: How are you going to fund your education? 
I come from a feudal background and has ample farmlands and livestock, after my dad passed away in last summer I inherited that money being the only heir. So a good reserve that I got and on top of that after working for 3 years I have enough funds to support my education and stay their. Handed her my 125 Million RS bank statement. 
She looked it over. Typed in the computer and then said Sorry I am unable to offer you a visa at this time, please read this yellow slip and research online on our website and try again. Thank you.
Please dear members, can you guide me what did I do wrong or anything that has to be improved in my application or profile as I am planning to reapply for the visa.

I need help, 
I have been rejected once on 25th May 2021
Program Master in Engineering Management 
Indiana Institue of Technology.
I have 3.05 CGPA in bachelor.
I 
was first sponsoring by my uncle and he is a US citizen... 
I was rejected in interview.
I have taken admission in university in the same state where my uncle lives.
Now, for 2nd time, what can I do? 
Can I change university and go with the same sponsor or not? 
Actually, my father in Pakistan has no cash money in bank and all are invested in property.
So, I have no bank statement in Pakistan 
So, if I arrange 50,60Lacks from invester so I must pay 2.5 Lac to him 
So, I want to know that is there any chance of visa if I change my university and get admission in other state where my uncle is not living and go with same sponsor (my uncle) or not?
Your replies would highly appreciated

Why this university.

Did you applied Pakistan universities?

IELTS: 8.0
Questions VO asked me:
VO: Is it a masters program?
ME: Yes, masters.
VO: Why are you going to the US?
ME: To pursue my masters degree in Human Resource Management from Northeastern University in Boston.
VO: Did you apply to any other universities?
ME: Yes, I applied to two other universities. Boston University and University of Notre Dame, in Indiana. 
VO: Were you accepted to any of those?
ME: I was rejected by Notre Dame but accepted into Boston University.
VO: Have you ever travelled abroad?
ME: No, I haven't
VO: So you have a brother in the US?
ME: Yes, my brother lives in US. He is also a graduate of Northeastern University. And is currently working there in a company. 
VO: Why did you choose to pursue this program now?
ME: Well I graduated last year with my bachelors degree. Since then I've been working in a school as an English teacher. I was made HOD of the English department & I became interested in HR management. And since there weren't many good options for this degree in Pakistan, I thought why not go to the US.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME: My father is my sponsor.
VO: What does your sponsor do?
ME: He is a recently retired police officer from Punjab police. He currently owns a pharmacy business in Lahore.
VO: Ok, I'm approving your visa. 
I found the VO to be very professional. He would interrupt most my answers by saying ""Ok got it"" when he wanted me to stop talking and I would. I was honest and confident. That's the key. Also your choice of University really matters, in my opinion. 
3 guys were rejected before me. 1 girl who went before me was approved.  They were all re-applying. This was my first attempt. 
Good luck everyone!

Hello Aslawalakum To all members.
My interview was on 22th December .Karachi Conusulate Counter number 6.
Visa Rejected.
Me: Good Morning Sir.
Vo:Rude korean guy no reply.
Vo: 
Pass me your i20 and passport.
Me: Yes sure sir with very smile.
Vo:Why Us?
Me: US is famous for their quality of education and technology. Bachelor's degree from the USA is highly recognized back here in Pakistan. Thats why, i want to pursue my bachelors in computer science from the USA and come back to Pakistan and start a training and IT consultancy firm.
Vo: Nice , Why this university?
Me: It is a highly ranked university in the USA. They have small size classes and highly talented faculty. They focus on student learning and growing and also provide internships so you can get real world experience during your degree. Also another reason would be that based on my academic profile this university has offered me 70% scholarship. I believe I can learn alot from St Thomas university and bring it to my country and share that culture and knowledge.
Vo: Is there any relative in Minnesota?
Me: No sir .
Vo: Here is your passport good luck for next time.
Please Tell me what should i do now?
Actually my ds 160 payment was done by my brothers friend and also sevis fees was paid from an American card ,he is living in st thomas university.
What should i do now?
This korean is very rude at counter number 6.
Can anybody help me in this situation as i am under 18. My academics results are all A*.

Suggestion Needed! 
I got rejected for my F1 Visa in the first attempt. VO asked me about my finances and I told her that I'm self-sponsoring myself and that I got the money from my father. She also asked about my employment where I told her that I'm currently unemployed. Before all of you guys start lecturing me how terrible my answers were, I already know that. So, kindly give me suggestions what should I change for my 2nd interview. 
1. Should I show my father as my sponsor 
the next time? If yes, than should I show his bank statement or mine. I have the money in my own account currently. The problem with this case is that my father is a businessman but as most of the businesses in Pakistan, the documentation is not proper and I can't prove the source of these funds. 
2. My uncle has a multinational company which is strongly related to my field. I could show him as the sponsor and show strong financial documentation.  
Kindly tell me which scenario would make my case strong.

There was an energetic guy who was attempting third time for his undergrad with almost 45k yearly scholarship. He got his visa. 
I feel that between the time I paused and should be talking and giving him more information. 
The interview was smooth and I must say it wasn’t my best shot. 
Looking for suggestions for my second attempt. 
What should I change?

Hello everyone,
My spouse had an appointment yesterday for J-2 Visa. But it was rejected on the basis of cousin marriage.  Our marriage was held last year in Pakistan before my arrival in the USA. But the Embassy Councelor told my wife that cousin marriage is not allowed to get Visa as per Texas State rule.
Please can someone guide me what should be the possible way to solve this matter?
Thanks and Regards

Interview: 16th June 2022
Interviewer: A lady
PhD Civil Engineering, University of Kansas.
Morning Mam,
VO: 
Morning
Questions:
What's University name in US? 
KU
What's your Major? 
Civil Engineering
Why were you in China? 
Study
Was that on scholarship? 
Yes
Had a same major in China?
Yes
Which University in China? 
Told
What's your proposed research in US? 
Told
So you have an assistantship, who's is your supervisor? 
I told her the name of my supervisor, she searched the internet and she asked me to spell it because she couldn't find it.  Then I passed her the CV of my supervisor and when she saw his profile, she searched on the internet again.  After typing a few seconds, she told me that, ""I'm approving your visa."" Congratulations.
#Tips
: Be confident and answer to the point, no need to explain. 
#Experience
: If you are having travel history and an assistantship then the interview is just a formality.
#Feeling
: I was feeling excited but once the shuttle bus driver and some other workers saw the ""approval slip"" in my hand they asked for ""Methai"".  I ignored them once but they kept asking for methai which was very annoying.  They have no ethics.  I spent 4 years in China and this was my second day in Pakistan after 4 years.  I saw many beggars on Islamabad road's and even in the embassy office today.

US J1 and J2 visa approved. ( long post)
Date: 27th Feb 2023. 
I went with my husband and two year old baby. Our interview was scheduled for 8:00 PM at Islamabad Embassy. We were there on time. 
After scanning fingerprints and other formalities we were sent to a counter that had a fat young American lady sitting with a polite expression on her face. The lady looked extremely professional.
Me: Good Morning
VO: 
good morning, pls pass me your documents.
Ok so I understand you are going for study.
Me: yes I am going for Exchange visitor research based trip to Uni of Michigan Ann Arbor. Its a six month scholarship fully funded by HEC and after completing it I'll be back and complete my PhD here. At Uni of Michigan I plan to have intensive research under the supervision of the my foreign supervisor who is also the chair of dpt of English language and literature Uni of Michigan
( all this time she was typing and looking on the screen but looked satisfied with my answer)
VO: ok so what is your research about?
Me: I am doing my PhD with majors in English Literature and subfield is Cultural memory and trauma studies with focus on politics of history in conflict zones. 
VO: wow interesting! Pls tell me more about Cultural memory studies, its new to me( she was smiling)
Me: Here I spoke for one minute on my research topic and the terms she was imtersted to know about.
VO: so what material you use for your research?
Me: well in arts and humanities we conduct corpus based research by which i mean we pick Anglophonic writings so I am working on indigenous writing from the Conflict zone of Kashmir. (She looked impressed)
VO: ok, I understand its a fully funded trip?
Me: Yes I bagged HEC IRSIP scholarship which is fully funded. 
VO: oh HEC the one which has headoffice here in Islamabad?
Me: I smiled, yes you got it right VO.
VO: are you both cousins?
Me: No.. just distant relatives.
VO: to my husband...ok I understand you have a brother in US who is US citizen.
( we mentioned this in our DS19)
Husband: yes certainly, my brother is living in New Jersy and doing a job there but I understand we are going to Michigan-a different state.
Vo: what's your profession.
Husband: I am banker by profession( he explained in little detail)
VO: do you guys have plans of settling in the US?
We both replied No at once. I added that we are satisfied with our jobs here so no plans.
VO: For how many years are you both married?
Me: told the exact time period and year. 
Vo: pls pass me your FRC.
Me: passed the the family and baby related documents. 
VO smiled and gave us a page that had rules of staying in the US. Took my DS and excused us for a while. After one minute she was back . 
Now my baby starting crying so she waved him Hi with a big smile. 
She got up from her chair, signed the DS and handed us over the blue slip with a nice smile. She added that we need to show this DS at immigration. 
We both smiled and thanked her and left the counter. 
Lessons:
When VO asks something speak out the details. Practice and research your answers. Stand straight and upright and constantly maintain eyecontact with VO. They read your facial expressions. So when you say No mean it and when you say Yes mean it. Prepare and practice. They make decision by having a thorough understanding of you. Have all your documents. Basically you need to impress them so that they show interest in you and grant you on the spot visa.
Good luck to all.

Date: 14th October 
Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Hello Everyone!!!
I hope you are all in good health.
My visa interview was on the 31st of October and VO put my case in AP (221g) and asked me to provide some documents like my CV and the potential supervisor's CV.
Up 
to now, I didn't get any update from the embassy. 
My classes are going to start on the 8th of January, what I should do?
1). Should I call the embassy about it?
2). Or I should email the university to give me an extension in enrollment?
3). Or I should ask them to defer my semester from Spring to Fall 2023???
4). Or, I should wait until the 8th of January,?

US VISA INTERVIEW
Hey guys, I recently appeared for the F1 visa interview and my visa got approved so I wanted to help you all. Here's a list of all the questions I prepared. The bold ones are the most important questions according to me.
https://docs.google.com/.../10EbWhCd0q2MkVwj8QC86.../edit...
Note: It was my first attempt and I applied for bachelors. A lot of questions might overlap for masters/Ph.D. students but be prepared to answer other questions related to work, research, etc.
TIPS:
1- Be prepared
If you thoroughly prepare for all the questions, you won't get stuck. It doesn't matter if you are not fluent in English or have other issues.  Give your best shot!
2- Be specific
Try to answer in a personalized way. Do not repeat general answers that the visa officers have heard thousands of times. You have to research the university website and google to create specific answers which are unique to you. Stand out from the crowd.
- Be confident
The visa officers are just employees who are doing their work and getting paid. Do not get preconceived notions about which visa officer is good or bad. I have read several times on this group that the visa officer was in a bad mood that's why they rejected me. This is simply not true, they have to write a specific reason when they reject an applicant. 
That's it. Remember me in your prayers.

22,"
Is there anyone who got a rejection after Administrative Processing (221g)? Will they notify by email that your visa is rejected?
I have given interview in Karachi Consulate on April 28, 2022 and since then status was ""Refused"" and the date stated of last update was April 28, 2022 but today I checked again and it still says ""Refused"" but date of last updated changed to July 14, 2022. I got no email.
So I am confused that my visa is still under administrative processing or is it refused.

By any chance does Visa Officer know how much Universities did I applied to?
Cause I have applied at only one and have been accepted there, but I'm worried that applying to only one university may give VO the wrong impression.
So when he asks, How much Universities did you applied to?

I say that I applied to Three other Universities with (name and details about them)?
Thanks

Hi everyone, need your valuable suggestions.
I applied for MSCS to USA back in July 2022 and got refused in 2 attempts, unfortunately. Now I'm planning for Australia for same degree but consultants are advising me that it'll be very weak case and another rejection is expected with high chances. 
Please add your valuable suggestions to make me a strong decision. 
JazakAllah Khair.

Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Today was my interview for F1 visa and I got rejected in Karachi Consulate.
Visa officer was a chinese young man.
The Visa officer asked me only two questions.
Why do you want to go to the US?
I answered him that , I want to go to the US to pursue my Master's in MPA in university of Albama.
Then 
he interrupted and asked me second question.
Why did you choose this uni specifically?
Firstly, I told him that I got accepted in three uni and I also mentioned the name.
Then I told him about practical courses which the uni has offered me.
Then he passed a white slip and said Sorry I cannot grant you visa, try next time.
He did not ask me anything , not about my sponsor,not about my future goals,my siblings, our business.
I have admiited to the university of Albama for Master's in public administration.
I have also took Duolingo English test and I got 120 marks.
I did my Bachelor's from GCU lahore in political science. After that I had been teaching in the college for the past 3 years.
So plz guide me what to do to get a visa ?

My advise for everyone, just be confident and be an active speaker. If they ask you a question, dont just answer them in a single word but start talking like ur having a normal conversation. They literally listen to your jargon even if it makes no sense lol. My sister lives in USA, but they didnt even ask me about her neither they asked for any other documents. 
Ek din pehle kisi dawat mai chale jaana taake uncles aise personal sawal tumse puche so that u know exactly what to answer. Thats exactly what i did lmao. 
Best of luck everyone.

Me: It's a digital construction through an automated operation of robot.
VO:Really ? Do you have any publications in this field ?
Me: Yes , 2 journal articles one in Cement and Concrete research and 2nd one is in Automation in construction.

Me : Sure sir ,you can have a look on the list that I've mentioned in my resume .
VO: Oh sorry , I didn't notice it.Amazing ,How did you  manage  to do such high quality research in your home country? 
Me: Only few of them , rest of the research specially in 3DPC are from Singapore ( NUS) .
VO: Excellent, NUS has excellent research facilities.What will be your future plans after getting PhD from Caltech ?
Me: Kind of , well sir actually I don't see any scope of 3DPC in my home country in next 20-25 years ,as this is highly advanced and emerging construction technology ,we still rely on traditional formwork construction, therefore , honestly speaking I'll be looking for a job in US or in Australia after having my PhD from Caltech in 3DPC .And...( VO asked ) .
VO: I see, this has to be an emerging and advance technology.You motivated me to study about it.chuckle..He called another guy on his back side and started discussing something while looking at my CV and I-20 .They were taking time ....
VO:Any travel history?
Me: Yes , Singapore, Japan , Turkey, UAE, Thailand and Malaysia etc.
VO: Looking at my old passport and verifying the informations and  said sorry we both have decided not to offer you a visa at this stage ( Gave me white slip) .
Me: shocked ! Any Reason sir. 
VO:a white slip .
Me: should I change my university for the 2nd attempt.
VO: it's not necessary, Caltech is best.
I was wondering and tried to get more Infos from there but couldn't succeed .
I still have the feelings that ties with country in this shouldn't be the case of visa  rejection.
 In addition,the VO didn't ask about GRE, siblings, sponsorship etc .

Asalamalikum. My case is bit unique. My visa was approved on 25 July on very first interview. After waiting for 2 weeks my passport didn't arrive so i emailed them for which they replied under processing. Ceac showed under administrative process. On 10 August ceac shows visa issued. But on 15 August i get an email that my visa was refused under 221g and asked me to give details of travel and residence from past 15 years.ceac shows refused. Still haven't received my passport. 
Do this happens a lot or its me. Please guide what should I do. Will I eventually get my Visa?

Hello 
My F2-visa interview was on the 21st of Dec and VO put my case in Administrative Procese (221g) and asked me to provide some documents but I didn't received any email. VO gave me a form and asked me to submit through QR/link and I have submitted documents but didn't get any update from the embassy yet. 
What should I do and what’s the expected waiting time for F2 visa ?
Suggestions please
Thankyou

Me: ok thank you.
THE TRICK IS to be Confident and natural like these questions don’t even matter and don’t get stuck while speaking. Try to stay to the point and not give a comeplete story for every answer you give.
My Experience: I came alone to a place near the embassy to stay. At 1 am I realized My mother hadn’t signed my I-20 I forgot to tell her to sign it.
My friend photostated my I-20 from the call center I worked at and delivered it to my home. 
At 2 am my parents left from Peshawar to give me the signed form. Then they asked to drop me off even tho it was just 5:30, I agreed and found out The roads were blocked and we had to take a long route.
I found out no InDriver no careem no Uber were available at the time. So it was a miracle my family came to drop me off. 
If I hadn’t forgotten to sign my form, my family wouldn’t have had come to drop me off and there’s a chance I would have messed things up 
But Thanks to Allah almighty things worked out.
Moral of the story if it’s written for you it will happen if it’s not Allah has better plans for you. Try try again
Best of Luck everyone May Allah bless us All

Attention Please,
Hello Everyone,
I want to share my two visa interview experiences and want your suggestions on what I did wrong and what I should do now.
1st attempt: November 10, 2022
Karachi Embassy,
1- Why are you visiting the United States?
Ans—to pursue a double major in economics and mathematics for my undergraduate degree at the University of South Dakota (raising his eyebrows after hearing economics and mathematics)
2- What are your future plans?
Ans— After finishing my degree in the United States, I plan to apply for CSS in Pakistan.
3- Where did you get to know about this university?
Ans—the university representatives visited my college at the university fair.
4- How will you fund your studies?
Ans— I got a partial scholarship of $4200, and the rest would be sponsored by my father, muhammad __
5- What does your father do?
A— he is a businessman, he has a business of Road freight logistics services business and a computer retail business.
I was rejected because I made an error while filling out my DS-160, as in my i20 it's business administration and management major, whereas in my DS-160 I filled out Economics with Mathematics. After noticing this mistake, I decided to reapply with a corrected DS-160.
2nd attempt: December 6, 2022
Karachi Embassy,
VO:-What are you going to study?
Me: to pursue a double major in economics and business administration for my undergraduate degree.
VO: Why the University of South Dakota?
Me: There are mainly two reasons: first, my majors are well organized and dedicated, like business administration major also focuses on data analysis, which attracts me. Second, I talked to a student there named Prah Haider, who is a representative of Pakistan, so I always got a positive response regarding campus activities, supportive administration, and the Pakistan community.
VO:- How many universities did you apply to?
Me: I applied to ten universities and was accepted by seven of them, seven of which I named.
VO: Did you apply to Pakistani universities?
""Yes, I applied to IBA, but I want to take advantage of the opportunity to study in the United States.""
VO:-What's changed from your previous rejection?
ME: Yes, I mentioned the wrong major in the DS-160 in my last interview. So here I am with the right one.
VO:- What did you fill in on the previous DS-160?
Me: I only mentioned economics with mathematics by thinking that economics is a business major, and I didn't mention the business major.
Then rejected on 214 b again.
Now I'm at a loss for what to do; I considered deferring my intake for fall 2023, but any advice on how to improve my chances of getting approval a third time would be greatly appreciated.

Status refused 6th March
My interview lasted for 10 minutes atleast everything was going in order. I dont know what is the reason of my  refusal. Experts please tell me what should i do now.
Me. Good morning
Vo. No reply. Give me your i20 and passport
Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world. Degree obtained from usa has much more worth then any of other countries here in pakistan. They also offer practicle courses, flexible education and cultural diversity further enhanced the educational experience. 
Vo. what are you going to study
Me. I going to peruse masters of cyber security.
vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.
Vo. Sory, we can not approve your visa this time and gave me slip.
Experts please tell me where did I go wrong.
"
59,"
Time and time again we see lot of posts on 
#VisaRefused
. And yet all of them have same mistakes. 
Issues with sponsor, lack of enthusiasm for program of study, lack of preparation, and a very strange one; judging the visa officer based on their looks or ethnicity. 
Please keep this in mind, whether visa officer was an american woman, or a Pakistani guy, your refusal has nothing to do with them. They are professional people and authorized to refuse anyone if they doubt the 
intentions. Instead of judging them and setting expectations before the interview, think of not giving them any reasons. 
Keep three things in mind; Be prepared, Be knowledgeable, and Be confident. If you are well prepared for your answers, did your homework, have chosen the right university and sponsor, you don’t have a reason to be nervous. 
But here’s the problem. Most of you don’t know why you want to study, why you chose a certain program and university and furthermore why you only want to study in the US. When you don’t know any of this, you are bound to make mistakes. 
2nd thing, why you guys don’t know the rules and laws of country where you plan to go? Why you are not aware that you can’t apply on immigrant and non immigrant visa at the samw time? Why you are not aware that you can’t get sponsorship from a relative already living in US, that too not your parents. Anyone other than parents as a sponsor is red flag, anyone sponsoring you from the US is red flag 
 
All of these mistakes make things difficult for genuine students too. When every other student appearing for interview have a clear intention to settle in the other country and no interest in studies, why should they give permission to enter their country??
Please please do some homework and ask yourself why are you constantly repeating the same mistakes.
P.S. don’t inbox me please. You are killing the point of this post. I am not here to take a look at everyone’s personal case.

Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Status: Approved, received passport in three days.
Date: April 13, 2022
Consulate/Embassy: Islamabad.
Major and University: Bachelor’s in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts Amherst.
My interview was scheduled for 11 AM, but I got to the Embassy at around 8 AM and the guards allowed me to enter early. I was out of the embassy by 9:15-ish. The interview itself only lasted 3 minutes.
I was asked the following questions:
1: What’s your major.
2: Why did you choose this university.
3: How many did you apply to.
4: Show me your scholarship letter.
5: What does your father do.
6: How much land does your father own.
7: Has he ever travelled outside Pakistan.
8: Have you travelled outside Pakistan in the last five years.
9: What do you intend to do after the degree.
The only thing the VO saw was my admissions letter with scholarship (14,000 USD per year, and funding from my father is 45,000 USD).
There are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about the Visa process here.
If you can:
1: Establish yourself as a genuine student;
2: Show concrete proof of funding;
3: Convince the VO you will return to Pakistan,
You will NEVER be denied the Visa.
1: Establishing yourself as a genuine student:
One of the best — or maybe the only way — to convince the VO that you’re a genuine student is to apply and get accepted to top public or private universities. I applied to 16 public colleges (all top 100 for my major) and I was accepted to 13, Alhumdulillah. There is no such thing as a “visa ratio”; as long as your university is highly ranked for your major, and is selective, you’ll get the visa.
My advice: Please do not hire consultants to apply to universities on your behalf. They only have very low ranking universities that will negatively impact your chances of getting a Visa.
2: Proof of funding:
It’s very important to convince the VO that you/your sponsor can fund at least a full year of living and tuition in the States. My VO did not even ask to see my bank statements, and that was probably because I told her what my father did, and that I had received more scholarships from other universities but ultimately chose UMass because it had a better ranked program — UMass did not offer me the highest scholarship from my list. This convinced the VO that my father can, indeed, fund my stay in the States.
3: Strong ties to home country:
Convince the VO that your entire family is in Pakistan and — if your father owns a business — tell them that you’ll inherit the business. This is usually ample proof.
Also, English speaking skills and confidence go a LONG way. I believe my interview was so short because I was speaking English very naturally and confidently. Which may be why the VO did not even ask for more documents.
I understand that a lot of applicants may not be able to speak English fluently, and I would strongly advise them to invest in English speaking classes at least three months before the interview. If you’re not going for a language program, it’s imperative to have a strong grip on English.

Long post Alert!
First Attempt

Interview date: 13th October
Karachi Embassy
University of Dayton, Ohio
Course: Masters of science in Civil Engineering

VO was that young lady.
Interview Starts: (It was a very long interview)
Me: Good Morning, Officer!
VO: Hi! Please scan your fingers and then she asked me to pass her the I-20 and passport.
Me: Sure officer.
VO: So What did you choose to study at USA?
Me: Officer, Master of Science in Civil engineering from University of Dayton and I’ll be specializing in Construction Engineering and Management.
VO: Why did you choose this concentration specifically?
Me: Officer It aligns with my interests and I will be studying courses such as….. VO interrupts
VO: What made you choose this concentration specifically?
Me: Previously, I have done my bachelors thesis in Construction management, and I did great in this area and that developed an interest in me for choosing this concentration.
VO: What was your thesis about?
Me: My thesis title was XYZ and I used Qualitative and Quantitative methods for the findings. I explained her my findings too.
VO: Pass me your CV ( Note: I also had the research paper of that thesis but she didn’t ask me for that)
VO: So is your program thesis-based?
Me: Yes officer, it is thesis based as It is Master of science so we have to do the thesis work.
Vo: So in which Topic you gonna do the thesis?
Me: Officer I have interest in BIM, Rivet and other application software so definitely I’m gonna look into that.
VO: In which Unis did you applied to?
Me: I applied to 5 universities and I got admit from 4 of them; University of Dayton, University of Texas at Arlington, Thomas Jefferson University and University of Kansas but I was rejected by Florida State University.
VO: Why this University?
Me: I choose this university because of the top-notch faculty at University of Dayton. I recently talked to Dr. XYZ, who is the professor at UD and he told me that he has been working on projects related to BIM, Rivet and other application software which are the emerging Technology here in Pakistan so I would love to take part in these projects if I get a chance.
VO: Why only USA?
Me: As being a civil engineer, we follow american building standards in our designing phase and while testing materials… VO interrupts 
VO: Why not UK or any other country?
Me: UK doesnot follow american building codes which I have learned previously so they won’t me useful for me once I get back to Pakistan.
VO: Then why are you not completing your masters in Pakistan?
Me: Because Pakistan does not use advance technology in their research system as USA has done a wider range of research contribution in the field of civil engineering and construction management. That why I believe US is the ideal place for me to pursue my higher education.
VO: Are you currently working?
Me: Yes, I’m working as a Trainee Engineer at XYZ Company.
VO: What is your work there?
Me: Officer, my job responsibilities include inspection of roads, ensuring the progress of the project to supervisor and so on….
VO: Who will be sponsoring you?
Me: My father will be sponsoring me.
VO: What does he do?
Me: I told her my father’s occupation and his annual income in total.
She kept on typing……
Vo: Are you sure this much income?
Me: Yes officer. (I was confident because I had all the financial docs but she never asked for that)
VO: Which department is your father in like under which ministry does it comes in?
Me: Told her that.
VO: Have you ever visited to USA before?
Me: No, I haven’t yet.
VO: Do you have any siblings?
Me: Yes, I have two elder siblings. (Told her about their jobs).
She kept on typing…..
Vo: So do they live with you or lives separately?
Me: We all live together.
VO: How long will be your stay in US?
Me: It will be 2 years long officer.
VO: So, what is your dream job?
Me: Once I will complete my masters, I will return to Pakistan and I will rejoin the same firm…. VO interrupts
VO: So, it’s your dream job to rejoin your same company? (Sarcastically smiles)
Me: No officer, My long-term plan and my dream is to establish my open construction firm in Pakistan as the construction Industry is already booming here.
(During this answer, she kept the yellow slip in here hands and for a sec, I thought it’s a rejection because of that colour)
VO: Congratulations, I’m approving your visa. Do collect your passport in..
 (After hearing the approval, I don’t remember what exactly she said lol)
Me: Thank you so much officer, Have a great day!
Note: None of my answer was ONE-WORD and all the answers were relevant to my program. You must make a story in your head which shows you’re academically well enough and your answers should be mentioning your home ties with your country. (DONOT COPY OTHER’S GENERIC ANSWERS)
The thing that helped me was my Trust in Allah, which is very important. Secondly, I worked day and night for 5 months and I did my own research throughout the process. My GPA was below average but I still managed to get the admissions and visa.

ME: Good Morning (with a smile)
VO: Which program are you going for?
ME: I am going for M. in HealthCare Analytics from RMU. 
VO: I see you were previously refused twice, why did you change your university and course?
ME: After my previous refusal I had plenty of time to search for a better option. I applied at RMU and pivoted my area of study as I believe Analytics has greater demand here in Pakistan. My own company recently moved from its old database to an advance one, and company had to hire 3rd party employees to train us. I realized I need to upgrade my skills in Analytics and Computing to advance my career. 
VO: Where do you work?

VO: (asked some details about his business) 
ME: Answered along with his annual turnover. 
VO: ( with a little giggle) Don’t your father wants you to takeover his business? 
ME: ( with a cheesy smile) No, because I already have my foot in the carrer in Pharma, I have a Doctor of Pharmacy degree. ( Mentioned my degree because father’s business has nothing common with it). 
VO: (After a short pause) how many sibling do you have? 
ME: I have a younger sister who works at the Aga Khan University Hospital as a xyz. 
VO: So, your previous qualification is of masters? (Looks intensely at the screen)
ME: No, its of Doctor, its a five year degree program. 
VO: Oh! ( paused and started typing at the screen for a minute).
Then came the Golden words “Your Visa is APPROVED, collect your passport bla bla bla” 
ME: ( Still in Poker face) Thank you, Have a nice day. 
VO: you too.

I’ve been refused twice for F-1 visa. I don’t know what VO is looking for. Please guide the following:
-> Should I change my university this time?
My university in previous attempts was SIUE (with 8K/year) scholarship. I’ve been accepted in Purdue Northwest (without scholarship) too, should I go with SIUE  or change it to Purdue?
-> 
My uncle were my sponsor in previous attempts. Now my principal sponsor is my father. (Circumstances changed)
Please guide what should I do as I’m a genuine student with a good profile but still they are refusing me. Should I only go with changed sponsor or should I change university too?
Profile:
BS ECE (3.43/4.00)

I am writing this post not to share my visa interview but to share something we all need to look upon. Me along with 6 of my peers/friends did not only get into us universities but we got in with  scholarships and had no issues with visa at all. Why am I trying to convey this? Because we started with the rigut process, that made us actual students and not just people entering us to settle. We all started with deciding good top tier universities including columbia, NYU, U 
miami, UCL etc. Not only we did extensive research on universities but we knew what program we wanted to and did work as actual students. We did not consult any consultants before applying or even cared about the visa at that time. We just wanted an acceptance with a scholarship and visa was the second part. I just want to say is do your research, apply for universities, make an effort of getting into top universities, see it as an opportunity to learn and not to settle there and everything will fall in place. They will grant you visa if you only satisfy their 3 conditions, which are if you are a genuine student, your funds and your family ties. Scholarship and acceptance in good universities cleared the pathway for all 6 of us and everyone of us got visa under 30 seconds. Don't try to fool the system because the system and people managing the system are 100 time smarter than you think!

Need suggestions from seniors and experienced students/individuals
Assalam o Alikum Guys, 
What is the best time to book my F1 visa interview for Fall 2023 semester. I am planning to reappear in visa interview in March or April 2023 but I am bit curious isn't it too early to appear in visa interview for Fall 2023? or should I appear in June or July 2023? 
P.S. 
I got refused twice in December 2022 for F1 (Masters). I have contacted my university and deferred my semester to Fall 2023. I received my updated I-20 for Fall 2023 as well. The Fall 2023 classes will be starting from August 2023.

VISA EXPERIENCE 
VISA APPROVED,ALLHAMDULLILAH
21July'22 9:00am ( hardly 5 mints interview)
Visa officer -chinese looking guy( Karachi embassy)
Vo : good morning 
Me: 
hello good morning Vo
Vo: please put your fingers on scanner, pressed tightly the pinky finger ( in a laughing way)
Me: does as told
Vo: oh I see you are working in a bank?
Me: yes I work in a local bank of Pakistan as Trainer / quality assurance executive in customer satisfaction and quality department. I train freshly hired officer (said a bit proudly:p)
Vo: why are you going to USA?
Me: i am going to USA for pursuing my MBA in marketing from New Mexico Highland University,  lasvegas 
Vo: How did you get to know about this university?
Me: my previous university professor recommended me this uni as he was an alumni of nmhu. Beside this I searched this university through different website like us news, niche and master portal.
Vo: you have such a stable job, why you want to leave it ?
Me: after becoming Trainer I didn't thought to go for masters degree because I was already achieving my goals step by step. But recently I got rejected for a managerial post in my company with a reason that I am not holding a masters degree and( as this was eligibility criteria for managerial post) this thing hit me harder and then I decided to apply for Mba. ( tbh it's a true story)
Vo: oh i see, after looking at my I 20 meticulously he said, oh who is xyz( my sponsor's name)
Me: he is my uncle who live in USA and is a US citizen 
Vo: what he do for living?
Me: He owns an It company named as xyz. This company is in over 240+ location but he owns the Santonio location.
Vo: will you ask you employer for leaves or you will resign ?
Me: I have discussed this with my head of department, they are talking with HR let's see what they will suggest. You know every firm has it on policy. Even if the don't approve my sabbatical leaves I'll resign and rejoin after completing my MBA. I know I  will get the job with my acquaintance and credibility 
Vo: congratulations you VISA is approved. 
*Posting this for encouraging all those people who are scared of several things. My case my pretty critical, chances of rejection was high because of primarily two reasons:
1. My brother lives in USA currently he recently got graduated from Louisiana state university and is in opt right now( vo didn't even asked about him)
2. Secondly my sponsor was my mother's cousin who is a US citizen.
But that's not a big thing if your are confident and sound genuine, means your story should sound real not made up. The most important thing is your  faith in Allah. If you say that I have strong faith but stillyou feel scared and week then your beliefs are not strong. I would like to thanks 
Rana Ibrar
  who helped me to articulate my answers , encouraged and motivated me for acing this interview. I couldn't achieved this without his help.

Date 04 Nov, 2022
Time 8:30 Am
Officer was a young female. 
ME: Hello
VO: Can I have you documents?
ME: Sure Sir! 
VO smiled.
ME: SORRY Ma’am. 
VO: Smiled again and said “it’s okay atleast you apologised”
VO: So which university are you going to?
ME: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University or commonly called as Virginia Tech. 
VO: What level of study?
ME: Masters
VO: In which Subject?
ME: In Civil Engineering.
VO: And what will be your Concentration?
ME: Construction Engineering and Management. 
VO: Where did you complete your bachelor from?
ME: UET Peshawar.
VO: Will you be doing any research Project?
ME: Yes hopefully.
VO: And what research will that be?
ME: I’ll do research on BIM and Sustainability. 
VO: Okay I see. So who’ll be paying for you studies. 
ME: My Father. 
VO: So what kind of business man is he?
ME: No Ma’am, he’s not a business man. He is a ________ in ______. 
VO: Sorry what? 
ME: Repeated.
VO: Woah!! So is he like a Doctor?
ME: Yes exactly. 
VO: Why is he working in _______?
ME: Better opportunity I guess.
VO: Okay. I see you have relatives in the US.
ME: Yes ma’am but not any immediate relatives. Just extended family.
VO: Like who?
ME: Cousins and some aunts and uncles. 
VO: Are they in Virginia?
ME: No. 
VO: Okay I am approving your Visa. 
ME: Thank you!
NO other documents asked during the interview. 
I saw a post a day or two ago of someone mentioning their experience of the same date. They said that no one got approved. I just want to say that don’t get distracted by such comments. I was interviewed early and was out of the embassy by 8:30 and before me three people got approved. 
All I can say from my experience that University matters alot and never lie on DS-160. A lot of people on the group say that don’t disclose any relatives in the US. Half of my family is there and are citizens but when asked I told them the truth. 
Don’t let anyone discourage you. Apply to good, high ranked Universities, don’t lie on the DS-160, and always ALWAYS pray to Allah. And In Sha Allah youll get the visa.

Hi, I was refused 214(b) by the infamous Chinese/Asian V.O at Karachi consulate. Today 10-06-2022. I am sharing his questions and my answers, please guide what mistakes have I made. And when can I take another appointment at the earliest. 
Q1. What are you doing presently?
Ans: I am working as a Stack Developer (MERN) Stack application developer, this technology stack is based on JavaScript
The 
company with which I am working has their own products we deploy them as well, you have started here recently what were you doing earlier,? for three months I was working on my own and did projects, worked on my skills. Before that I worked for 3.5 years as an Automation Engineer at a pharmaceutical firm.
Q2. What are you going to study?
Ans: I am going to study, my Masters in Computer Science, in what field specifically in computer science? I replied Mobile Application Development, I want to focus on creation of Apps for Disabled People, having more accessibilty option.
Q3. Tell me about your family?
Ans: My parents and a younger sibling.
I stopped here, and I believe should have said more, he kept on typing and then rejected me.
Please guide me, what should I do to improve, my profile is as follows:
1. BS Electronic Engineer (CGPA: 3.06/4) 2016 Graduate.
2. Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Science 2020-2021.
3. IELTS (7.5/9)
No significant gaps in my education or career. One thing I would note is that the officer was uninterested in conducting the interview and was not interactive in the sense that, common questions were not even asked, Why US, Why this University, Who is sponsoring you. 
I have interacted with other students and this officer has rejected a number of candidates, he was not even reponsive to a Hi/Hello, rather I felt that he just wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. I am really saddened, today worked really hard for this. Please guide me and also when should I reschedule.

F-1 Visa Interview Experience
Karachi Consulate
Date: 30-1-2023
Profile:
Duolingo:125
Community College: Highline College
Major: Computer Science
Visa Status:Rejected
Age:16
Counter no: Don't remember, but I think it was 6
Visa officer appearance: A healthy American officer without glasses in his 30s
Time: 8:45 A.M
The ground for rejection I think is not being confident and not showing enough ties to Pakistan. Another reason I think it is for community college as I am not able to get admission in a university because I am under qualified (11th grade). I know it's stupidity to apply for visa for Community College but I will be saving two precious years of my life.
VO: Why are you going to USA?
Me: I am going to USA to pursue my education in Computer Science at Highline College
VO: Ok, what will you do after your 2 year program?
Me: I will transfer to Washington State University ( he interrupted me here and I wanted to say more that I will come back to Pakistan after completing my studies and my future plans. The reason I think I was under confident and I have stammering problems).
VO: Have you applied to WSU?
Me: No, I haven't ( he interrupted me here also. I wanted to say that I am in the grade 11 and I am under qualified to join the university, but joining to CC will help me to save precious years of my life. The reason why I was unable to say because I am under confident and I have stammering problems)
VO: How will you finance your education?
Me: I was telling my answer and he gave me a slip that you were rejected under 214(b).
It was my first attempt for visa interview, the whole process was smooth till the biometrics and there were not many people for the interview. A girl on another counter which seemed to be very confident got her visa approved and their conversation was very relax. So, I thought I will get my visa if I get a chance to convince the visa officer. But the whole situation changed in a moment and I was not able to face the situation because the interviewer is asking questions in hurry, I lost my confidence and I am only 16 and it was my first time.  I know I am making excuses, I have prepared a lot for my interview but I have stammering problem and the interview was only under 45 seconds.
My education plan is to study at Highline Community College and my major is Computer Science. The reason why I have chosen this community college is because I want to get admission in University of Washington, which is the world class university. Some people will say, complete your education till grade 12 and then apply directly to this university. But let me give you an interesting fact, the admission rate for international students for CS Programme for University of Washington (Direct to major) specifically is 4% only, whereas the transfer rate for CS Programme from this community college is 98% and these are real numbers. Some people will say now, apply visa for a university and then transfer to this community college. But I don't want to put myself in this hassle. The whole process from start to end, from admission to visa documents, was done all by myself and I don't hire any consultant. 
Should I reapply for visa, what you guys suggest?

Suggestions based on personal experience:
1st During visa don't talk about something which trigger Technology Alert List (TAL) (
https://www.vanderbilt.edu/.../visa.../technology-alert/
) 
2nd UN has 17 goals to be achieved by 2030 check here (
https://www.un.org/.../desa/disabilities/envision2030.html

Hello,
I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s graduate program (in NYC), with a financial aid award that covers tuition, Bard-sponsored housing/accommodation, and health insurance. However, expenses related to travel and food will not be waived and I’d be entirely responsible for managing them. Moreover, the program does not have any on-campus jobs/employment (I’m not allowed to live/work off-campus) and I would quite literally be on my own. I wanted to write here 
to ask for advice: Should I say yes to this offer? Is it possible to be a bit too frugal in New York and save money/stop myself from needless spending? Would I be able to manage? How can I bring down the remaining costs that have not been covered by my financial aid award? Any sort of assistance/piece of advice is welcomed.
Thank you very much.

Hello group members!
I want to do undergraduate in CS from MIT. I know it's extremely hard to land at this institution but I have a great academic record and academic achievements however I don't have done any major extra curricular activities. Alumni's of MIT suggest that you should have something in your profile that MIT lacks and you have to show them that you are able to fulfill the required gap in order to get accepted. CS is a very competitive field to get into, so 
please tell me which domain with CS combined should I choose in order to land at MIT? What extra curriculars should I do? And which thing that MIT lacks and what they are looking for in the students nowadays?
Please note that I am looking for some serious advice. So, if you don't have any advice, please don't make your input here.

Hello folks, I have two questions regarding shortlisting and filling applications of universities.
1)  Is applying to just 3 universities enough, rather than applying to 5 or 6 universities? I mean, is a person on safe side if he/she has applied to just 3 universities?
2)  I have received an official email from UT Arlington which says, 
**In addition to admissions documents, you will be required to submit financial and immigration documents in order to process your I-20. 
Although these forms may be submitted after an admission decision is made, early submission is encouraged.**
Does it mean this university has accepted my application or something else?
Dear members, I will be grateful if any seniors can explain this to me as I need really serious information on it.
JazakAllah khair

Bismillah, Alhamdulillah by the grace of Allah and prayers of my parents my visa has been approved.
Visa interview experiences
Here is the detailed post for all of my interview experiences from 2017 to 2021. 
It 
is going to be a long post so please bear the headache in your stomach while reading. However, I will try to make it short. 
So it all started when I completed my intermediate(HSSC) from Pakistan. I did my IELTS and applied through a consultant at Wichita state university. My score in IELTS was not that good also, I secured admission in a pathway program.  
1st interview experience.
Embassy: Islamabad
University: Wichita state university. 
Course: Pathway+ bachelors in Aerospace engineering. 
Date: I don't remember the exact date but I think it was on the 4th of Feb 2017. 
Vo: Good morning
Me: Good morning mam. How are u?
Vo: Give me ur documents
Me: Handed over my documents to her. 
Vo: Why are you going to us?
Me: I am going to pursue my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering.
Vo: Which uni?
Me: Wichita state uni
Vo: Why this uni?
Me: Told about uni curriculum, professor's research, etc.
Vo: How many unis u have applied to?
Me: 3 and named them.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: Father
Vo: What does your sponsor do?
Me: Told about my father's govt job and rental shops that we own.
Vo: Give me your bank statement?
Me: Gave her
Vo: Educational documents as well..
Me: I handed over all the documents to her. 
Vo took my passport i20 along with those documents which were asked ...
Ok, I am giving you this white sheet for processing ur documents..  means 221(g).
My case was transferred into the administration process where they verify documents I think. I was really happy as 90+% 221g cases are approved. When I left the embassy and check the online status, it was saying refused. I was stunned that how it could be possible that after one hour of my interview, they refused me. Anyhow, after a few days, I got an email to pick up your documents from .... location, I picked up my documents along with 214B sheet. It was really unfair to me as everything was genuine and still, they rejected me.. 
I thought to apply again as I wasn't aware of the reason for rejection. 
2nd interview experience.
Embassy: ISL
University: I applied with the same university and with the same course as it was in my first interview.
Date: It was in March 2017
The visa officer just asked 3 questions.
VO: Which uni?
Me: Wichita state university.
 VO: Have you ever visit any country?
Me: No, never.
The Visa officer handed over me 214b and said I cannot approve your visa, I left the embassy without saying anything.
3rd interview experience. 
Embassy: ISL
University: Same uni and course.

Vo. Ok, give me your bank statement.
Me. Gave

Vo. Another question was in urdu but I can't remember.
After looking at me he gave me yellow slip n me apko abi viisa nai de sakta but ap or counsler se try kr skty hain agr ap mutafik hain..
After getting 3 rejections, I thought to apply to more universities and I got accepted into 5-6 universities this time. I selected Indiana tech university as I was having a good amount of scholarships. 
4th attempt.
Embassy: ISL
University; Indiana institute of technology with $13000 scholarship.
Course: Bs mechanical engineering without any pathway.
Date: August 2017.
Intake: Fall.
VO: which uni? 
Me: Indiana tech.
Vo: Why you are going for engineering again?
Me: I said, I did intermediate here in Pak but not engineering. 
Vo: which program?
Me: bs mechanical eng.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father is sponsoring me along with this I have secured a 13000$ scholarship from that uni,
Vo: what does your father do?
Me: Same answer. 
Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is written in this paper(214B).
After getting a rejection, I thought to apply again for the Spring intake. 
5th attempt.
Embassy: ISL.
University: Same as it was in 4th attempt.
Date: 31 November 2017
Intake: Spring.
Vo: Where are you going?
Me: Fort Wayne biggest city of Indiana state,
Vo: Can I explain the changes in my profile?
Vo: no thanks,
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: Father 
Vo: What does he do?
Me: same as I used to speak for my sponsor in previous interviews.
Vo: I cannot approve your visa. 
Me: Thanks.
It was my fifth attempt and had wasted almost two years for the same. I can apply for Australia or Uk at that time, my brain was saying to apply in other countries and my heart was like no no you should go to the USA as it has been my biggest wish to get a USA visa and study over there. 
Anyways, I decided to complete my bachelor's here in Pakistan and apply again for my master's study in the states. 
I completed my bachelor's degree in October 2020 with a 3.7 CGPA.
I took the Duolingo test(alternate of IELTS due to Covid days) and scored 130. Right after completing my bachelor's, I applied to 4 universities with the help of Asim Sahab(my career counselor) Depaul University, Saint Louis University, Oregon state university, and I got accepted in all of them with partial scholarships for spring intake 2021. 
After getting admits, I thought why not apply to some well-ranked university. I dropped off my plans for Spring intake 2021 and applied to Northeastern University(Ranked under top 50 universities nationally according to US News ranking) by myself with the help of Zaryab(A great friend of mine). I got admit from it for the fall intake 2021.
After getting i20, I applied for an appointment from US embassy ISL. I got an appointment for 13th July. 
6th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 13/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
It took almost 1 hour I believe by going through the routine process from shuttle service to embassy.
I wasn't aware of that bald guy who was famous for rejections. Unfortunately, I had to give my interview to the same VO. He rejected a student before me.
Me: Good morning.
VO: No reply.
Vo: Can you pass me your documents?
Me: Sure.
Vo: Let's take fingerprints first. 
Me: I did the same and asked if it is done?
Vo: Yeah.
Me: Cool.
Vo: Why are you going to the US?
Me: I am going to us to pursue my master's in project management from Northeastern University, Boston. 
Vo: Why did you choose this school?
Me: I asked him to repeat the question as his voice was not clear.
Vo: He repeated the question.
Me: Besides its ranking that comes under the top 50 schools nationally according to US news ranking I choose NEU due to its course curriculum that offers different electives, workshops and a capstone project,  (Vo interrupted me)
Vo: Who is paying for your trip?
Me: Father.
Vo: What does he do?
Me: I was explaining about my father job and business( He interrupted again)
Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is mentioned in this paper(yellow sheet, here he handed me two yellow sheets, I was like o bhai mere pas dher laga huwa yellow sheets ka already 
 )
Me; thanks and left the embassy with a shattered heart as I was really prepared for this attempt and made many changes in my profile this time. Anyhow, I decided to reapply as It seems unfair to me without knowing the reason he rejected me even he was not listening to my answers. 
I did not bother to change anything in my profile as I did not exactly know the reason for rejection. 
7th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 30/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
Before me, one student visa got approved who got rejected previously and the visa officer asked him what changes he made in his profile he said no changes as he was not confident last time and now he is. He got his visa approved. 
after that student officer asked me to move forward.
Me: good morning how are you doing?
Vo: He said good thank you,
Vo: I see you have been refused already so what changes do you bring out this time?
Me: I don’t feel to make any changes in my profile since I have gotten admission to a highly ranked university in USA with a course curriculum that is perfectly aligned with my future plans of Pakistan, 
After listening to that he was continuously seeing his computer screen, I guess he must be checking my previous interview experiences,
After a few minutes, he told me I cannot approve your visa the reason is the same as before, 
I said is it permanent rejection as this is my 7th attempt, 
He said, you have too many rejections and you need to change the circumstances. 
I left the counter.
I thought to change my sponsor and added my mother as my sponsor in my DS160. I thought to try changing sponsor so maybe it could work. 
8th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 11/08/2021 / 10:15 Am
VO was a big beard guy with his 50-55. 
Me: Hi sir, how are you doing?
VO: good morning, can you please scan your fingerprints.
I did, then VO told me to pass my documents. 
VO: what is the purpose of your trip?
Me: I am going to us to pursue master's in project management from northeastern uni, Boston.
VO: who will bear the expenses?
Me: My parents.
VO: What do they do?
Told about the parent business and job. In the end I said, we have a savings of 52k$. Do you want to see the bank statement?
VO: no, not needed.
VO: Have you ever visited any country?
Me: No, I never visited any country.
VO: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Me: Yes I do have.
VO: what do they do?
Me: One of my brothers is a chemical engineer and working as senior chemical eng in service industries, other siblings are still studying.
Then he started typing and after 30-45 seconds he said, Us laws are really strict and I cannot approve your visa.
I said, sir, is there anything wrong with my profile as this is my 8th attempt for f1 visa? 
VO: there is nothing wrong with your profile and you did not change anything in your profile.
I said I have changed my sponsor this time as I added my mother to my sponsor list.
VO: sorry.
I said thank you and left the counter.
After this attempt, I decided to change my university and reapply again.  I was also thinking to change the embassy but dropped off this plan as in my point of view embassy does not matter at all. 
I deferred my admission to Depaul university to spring intake 2022 and applied for the i20. I got an electronic i20 at the end of august and paid the fee again for the appointment.
9th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Depaul University, Chicago
Course: Master of Science in business analytics ($6k scholarship)
Intake: Spring 2022
Status: Approved
Date&time: 17/09/2021 / 8:00 Am
Vo was a really great guy in his 50+. Before me, the visa of one girl got approved. Luckily, I did not see the bald guy there and there were two VO's that were taking the interviews. I observed they were approving visas for most of the candidates. I was the last one being interviewed in the embassy. My visa interviews went smoothly. 
Me: Good morning officer, how are you doing?
Vo: Hi, good.
Vo: Fingerprints, I said is it done? , he said yeah. 
Vo: So, Mr.... you were there before uhmm..... He scanned my DS160.
Me: Yes, my visa has been refused 3 times this year. I want to say something. Actually, last time visa officer told me to change something in my profile and reapply. Now, I have changed my university with a more popular and advanced STEM degree that has a promising career in Pakistan. My intentions are to get my master's degree from the USA and come back to Pakistan to work as a business analyst in one of my dream companies that is Nestle. 
Vo: hmmm...
Vo: He was seeing the previous visa officer's comments on his screen, he got up and went back to talk with someone, I guess he was speaking about the visa officer who had rejected me before. He made some funny comments with his colleague and smiling.
Vo: So, you have applied to this embassy?
Me: Yes, I have applied to the ISL embassy. 
Vo: Have you ever applied to the KHI embassy?
Me: No, never. 
Vo: He scanned my ds160 3-4 times. I don't know why. He then wrote down his comments. After some time, Ok Mr.... you are good to go, your visa has been approved and you will get your passport within 5 days. He returned back i20, ds160, blue sheet(Approval sheet) and put my passport in the basket.
Me; Thanks, officer, thank you so much. 
Vo: Have a nice stay in the states while smiling. 
Me: Inside me( yeah yeah buddy why not).
I was literally crying when I was leaving the embassy, it was like a dream come true for me. 
I would like to thanks a few members of this group who helped me a lot during my interview experiences.

F-1
Rutgers University, Newark
Masters in Peace and Conflict
Program start date: 30th Aug
Classes start date: 6th Sep
Appointment Time: 9:00 A.M, Sep 2
Interview Time: 12:40 a.m
VO was the lady with glasses.
Questions:
VO: Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going for my Masters in Peace and Conflict Studies
Which University?
Me: Rutgers University, Newark Campus
VO: To which other Universities you applied?
Me: Michigan State University and Georgia State University
VO: Who will sponsor you?
Me: My father
VO: What does he do?
Me: Construction Business and owns rental properties
VO: How many employees?
Me: 35
VO: What is your age?
Me: 32
VO: No, You are not 32...( I was like what the heck)
VO was typing for a few seconds
VO: We are sorry but you are not eligible this time.
I was given yellow slip of Failure to establish ties.
I was really interested in this program because it was a sociological and anthropological approach to Peace and Conflict studies which is rare.
VO didn't check my documents. She didn't even look at my I20 and Passport thoroughly. She was looking at the screen, the whole time, and asking questions very rapidly. She even didn't look at my documents. I applied by myself to all universities and was selected in all of them. I filled my dS-160 my self. I reviewed my whole application by US friends who went on F1 visas and nationals as well. I had every document prepared for strong ties including Property documents. The list of documents were as follows;
1. Passport
2. CNIC
3. Appointment Confrimation Page
4. Appointment Fee Payment Receipt (Allied Bank Receipt)
5. DS-160 Confirmation Page
6. SEVIS fee Payment Confirmation
7. I20
8. Admission Letter
9. Bank Statement
10. Original Academic Documents
11. Resume
12. FRC
13. Residential Certificate
14. Police Clearance
15. Fard Nama of my Father's property (Only Translated Document in English)
16. Property Evaluation Letter
17. 2×2 Passport Photos (White Background)
18. Parents' CNIC Photocopies
19. Late Arrival Letter
20. IELTS
21. Birth Certificate
22. Experience and Approval Certificate from the NGO where I work
23. COVID-Vaccination
I was fully prepared and confident because I had a very strong profile but she didn't even check a single document. Well, I don't know the reason. May be her mood was off as she was interviewing Afghan immigrants before me for immigration visa and it took a lot of time. My prospective interview time of 10:15 a.m was delayed to 12:40 p.m. Hence, I came under fire.  
Sorry but its a shame.
This group helped me a lot in preparation. I feel awkward and kind of bad because there was no deficiency on my behalf. I am confused and need some insight for next applies. I will go for funded programs this time so that the only chance of rejection is also eliminated. I will also consider applying for funded PhD political science programs. I will really appreciate any kind of helpful guidelines. 
Thank you.

VO: Good morning please pass me your documents. 
Me: 
Good morning officer. 
VO: Put your fingers of left hand on the scanner 
Me: Okay. 
VO: So why are you going to U.S?
Me: I am going to attend Master's in Career Counseling from Florida State University. 
VO: It says it is a educational specialist degree program?
Me: Yeah it's both master's and specialist degree program. 
VO: Why career counseling?
Me: Because it's the need of the time. And I have personally struggled with career decision-making difficulties when I was done with high school.  That's why I did my bachelor's thesis on career decision making difficulties among adolescents. 
VO: And why Florida State University?
Me: Florida state university is one of the few universities offering both Master's and specialized degree program in Career counseling. It has also funded me through an assistantship in career center of the university. It's covering my tuition fee. The VO didn't let me complete and asked
Yeah you have an assistantship but you still have to pay for expenses how are you going to do that?
Me: Yeah absolutely I have to cover the rest and my uncle is paying for the cost of living. 
VO: What does your uncle do?
Me: He's a professor in a college in Abbottabad
VO: College?
Me: That's a medical college. 
VO: Why is your uncle sponsoring you? Why not your parents? 
Me: Well my uncle is my legal guardian. He's been so invested in my studies since the beginning in fact he himself did his Ph.D. from university of Glasgow and he wants me to have an international exposure too. 
VO: Oh right, Do you have any relatives in U.S?
Me: No 
After 10 seconds pause, he handed me a blue slip. 
VO with a smile: Your visa is approved. You can take your documents. 
Me: Thank you officer.

Alhamdulilah! I 
got accepted to Fully Funded Masters 
Scholarship in Computer Science from 
Canada
 as well as 
America
.
HOW YOU CAN GET IT AS WELL?
1 line answer is: "" Good and Novel Research Work "" (Publication is not required).
A bit of 
detailed method
 (How I got the scholarship):
I have 
3.3 CGPA, and NO Publications
 but my research work is meaningful that I could write about it thoroughly in my Statement of Purpose.
Conduct good and meaningful research work in your home country (it means come with a problem and spend a few months or a year in solving that problem or problems in a good university or research lab under other professors, who can guide you).
Apply in Masters Thesis Programs only.
Write Statement of Purpose which should mainly focus on your research work and future prospects and reflects why this particular professor and university is the best match with your work (relate your work with prospective supervisor in the SOP, write his research paper titles and relate it with yours in 1-2 lines).
Get 3 Letters of Recommendations from your university (these letters should support and highlight your research work and what you have written in your SOP, it should not be generic at all (as most university professors give generic letters and they are useless).
Now, Choose universities you intend to apply based on your CGPA (like if you have just 3.0, then University of Toronto's scholarship doesn't make sense in your case) and follow these steps.
Visit Faculty profiles (related to your desired department of study), of let's say 20 different universities.
See the Google scholar and Personal Website of the Professors of that department you want to apply in. 
List down which 3 professors best matches with your research work and domain in those universities.
If there is no professor which matches with your research work, then do not apply in that university.
Write about his work and relate that to your work in your SOP.
Write him an email as well (after applying) that how his work was related and how you can assist him in his work and how his work fascinates you.
It would need you to read Abstracts of his recent research papers (to write, and relate such things in SOP)
Weightage to this method is 50% and 
rest of the 50%
 is Praying to Allah
Now Wait and be good to others. 
GREAT THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES AND HELP OTHERS.

Visa Interview Experience 
Profile: PhD Nutrition funded by Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. University of Minnesota.
Visa: J
Status: Accepted
In 
first window the guy verified my documents, checked my passport and pictures. Asked me if im married and asked about how long ago the picture was taken.
In second window my biometric was done
Then i waited for another 20 mins for my turn for final interview. My interview guy was bald man and he was older in age.
VO: Why are you going to US?
Me: To do my PhD in Nutrition 
VO: Why this university?
Me: I have worked a lot on nutraceuticals and superfoods. When choosing a university i wanted that my phd research is also around one superfood. So now I’ll be working on soy beans. Also the courses here at UMN are those that i am already familiar with but still need to gain technical expertise in. Like food analysis and food safety. And i have heard minneapolis is a beautiful city.
VO: ok ok and who is funding you?
Me: HEC
VO: I see that its partly funded by your university.
Me: Yes partly funded by university and rest by HEC so its completely funded.
VO: okay great. Congratulations. Enjoy your stay. Read the rules…… (couldn’t hear anything further as i was already crying almost)
I took the blue slip, my documents and almost ran out of the hall (as if he would catch me and give my passport back 
)
I was confident, i made sure that my answes are related to my research and reflect me and not any general answer. This is the key i think. Thank You everyone for all the support that I got.

VO: Where do you work currently?
(I told her my job title in clinical research and my work place)
VO: What do you do in your job exactly?
(I elaborated on my duties in my current job.)
VO: How will this course help you? What kind of career can you have?
(I elaborated on how research is something ive already been involved in since my undergrad years and im continuing that. And I told her the several different jobs I can get here in Pakistan. And how it’s a step up from my current work and job title.)
VO: Where would you find these jobs here (in Pakistan)?
(I told her about the place I want to work at in my city and the person there im interested in working with. I also mentioned my current workplace.)
VO: So you’re a medical doctor?
Me: Yes
VO: When did you graduate?
Me: three years ago
VO: Where did you graduate from?
(I told her my university name.)
VO: Where is this college?
Me: Here in ___ (my city) right next to the ____________hospital.
VO: What did you do since?
(I talked about my jobs since graduating. My intern year and then of course my current job.)
VO: Whos sponsoring you?
Me: My uncle and aunt and a Dean’s scholarship.
(I told her the names of my sponsors, and how the scholarship was merit based.)
VO: What do they do?
(I told her each of their job titles and place of work)
VO: (Again confirmed my uncle’s workplace).
Me: Yes.
(She was typing a lot and looking at something on her screen while I talked about my sponsors)
VO: Do you have any financial documents of your uncle and aunt. Anything I can see now?
Me: Yes, I have their bank statements and affidavit of financial support. Would that be fine?
VO: Yes.
Me: Sorry they have these post-it/tags on them
VO: That’s fine.
Me: Okay here you go. (I also ended up giving both their passport copies)
VO: Oh so theyre separate people, not married to each other?
Me: Oh no no, theyre both separate people, not related.
VO: Where do they live?
Me: My uncle lives here in (my city) at ____ and my aunt lives in ____ (abroad, not US)
VO: (She sifted through everything; the bank statements, my I20, and was carefully reading even the affidavit. I should highlight here that I assume my last two rejections for the B1/B2 visa were because of my finances, which is probably why she was carefully reading everything in my case. Just my opinion.)
VO: Alright I see you have enough for one academic year. What about your second year?
Me: Yes, I have the Dean’s scholarship well into my second year as well, and my uncle and aunt will continue to support me.
VO: Okay.
(Then she was reading through something on the screen. She was doing this a lot during my interview and overall for others too maybe, cause other people were standing idly by her counter as well for a while.)
VO: I see you have previous rejections, was that trip for the USMLE? (many interviewees that day were going for their USMLE Step 3 or clinical rotations, just btw)
Me: Um, not exactly. I was also going for my clinical electives at ______ (this is a top ranked university in the US) where I had the chance to work with Dr ____ and another clinical elective at ______ (a famous research hospital in the US) to work with Dr ____. (I was excitedly telling her about the Drs because I genuinely find them both to be amazing)
VO: Are you not giving USMLE now?
Me: No. As I said, I am not pursuing a clinical career anymore. Im pursuing research.
VO: (I don’t recall the exact question. She asked me to elaborate on my career change. Like why I wasn’t practicing as a medical doctor and why I’m currently pursuing this degree and research?)
(I told her about when I switched and what led me to change my career to research. I just answered honestly.)
VO: How have your circumstances changed since then?
(I got confused because I thought I already elaborated on my career change so I mentioned it again and how this is for a masters degree.)
VO: No, what has changed? Did your sponsors not fund your trip last time?
Me: Oh no, my aunt and uncle weren’t my sponsors then. It was my father. He was sponsoring my trip last time.
VO: What do your parents do?
VO: How come your aunt and uncle are sponsoring you this time? How did that happen? (again, I don’t remember her exact words but she wanted me to elaborate why I made this change and how my aunt and uncle came to be my sponsors this time)
(I explained how they became my sponsors. They have been supportive of me throughout my application cycle and offered to fund my education. And I accepted.)
VO: Okay.
(Then she kept reading something. Kept scanning my passport. Was mostly looking at her screen during my interview. This felt like forever.)
VO: Alright, everything looks okay.
(Now this I was unprepared for, what should I say now lol. Should I say thanks or okay? So I just kept quiet lol)
VO: Im approving your visa! (Then she went on to explain how I will get my passport in 3-5 days, that she will keep my passport but return my I20 and SEVIS page. How I should keep this safe and make sure to bring it with me while travelling for the US Port of Entry I guess. I was in sheer shock so I was just blankly staring)
Me: Thank you! Thank you, hope you have a wonderful day ahead!
Took my documents and my folder and just rushed out.
The interview was longggg, as you can read. My VO was taking long interviews of nearly everyone I could see in that counter but it was not necessarily a bad thing. A lot of them were approved; you just had to be concise in your answers. The length itself can be intimidating, but if you’re honest and you’ve done your homework it will go well inshaAllah.
My brothers were a great source of help for me. They conducted my mock interviews and helped me throughout. One of my brothers is on an F1 visa in the US and I mentioned it in the DS160 form as well. But as you can read, she asked me nothing about that. I even mentioned an uncle in the US in my previous DS160 form for my B1/B2 applications, but she asked nothing about that either.
I reached out to many Pakistani students in the US through friends and friends of friends who all told me about their visa experiences and how it’s so straightforward and nothing to worry about. They were all super supportive and encouraging as well.
I used this group and the F1 visa experiences group on facebook a lot to gauge the kind of questions I could be asked and to learn from other people’s experiences. I made it a point to read mostly the approved posts. The rejected posts, though a lot more in number, serve to discourage and demotivate you. But yes, you can also learn from them. I still suggest reading mostly the approved posts. I even reached out to 
Rana Ibrar
 who was so gracious with his time and advice and guided me. He conducted a mock interview, told me about all possible questions, and was overall very motivating. He basically said: Your visa is approved! Long before I heard it in the consulate lol. JazakAllah Abrar!
Good luck to everyone applying. The 3Cs mentioned in this group’s featured post is spot on, and you will find anyone on the internet saying the same. Your finances, credibility as a student, and your commitment to the course and country and laws is what’s important. Which they will gauge from your interview mostly. If you are a genuine student and your finances are in order you should have no problem getting that visa inshaAllah.

Dear Group Members,
One of the professors from University of Florida has accepted me to enroll in a PhD project under her supervision. The project is fully funded. Also, she has offered me to work as a teaching assistant at the department as well. 
Currently, I am clueless about the next steps (e.g., Visa processing and documentation). I would really appreciate if you all could guide me on the following points:
1) 
What type of visa options are available in my case? I am married and would take my spouse with me.
2) Besides degrees, passport and acceptance letter, what other documents would be needed?
3) How long does the whole process take?

Hello everyone
Received my F1 visa mere in a week in the first attempt. My experience of interview and message to those who are appearing for the interviews in coming days.
Interview was too simple and to the point. It was as follow:
VO:  
Hello 
Me: Greetings
VO: Pass me your documents 
Me: Hand over all the essential documents which embassy guys gather and put in the passport at the embassy gate
VO: Why you are going to USA?
Me: Could answer the other way too, but simply responded as for my doctorate degree
VO: In which university 
Me: Replied
VO: Did you find any supervisor? Alhough my I20 was with her but she still asked this question
Me: Replied
VO: Can you please tell the name of your supervisor. She asked about spelling of my supervisor name twice. 
Me: Replied
VO: Whats your major?
Me: Replied, while telling her about the major i got a point to let her know that my MS is also in the same major. Anyway briefed her and she looks satisfied
VO: Started working on pc for quite a time and told me to wait please. It took couple of mins as she was typing something continuously. 
Me: At this moment I was like man I am gonna get visa today. But she turned to me and hand over pink card and wait for the response. I didn’t hear at that moment properly  whether she was telling me to wait for the mail or anything else. Anyway said goodbye to her but she kept my passport. On the pink card word refused was written but it also mentioned about Administrative Process too. I had kinda mix feelings that time but was quite optimistic ad confident too. 
The things i noted while going through this whole process was the confidence of students that does more natters. I have seen boys shaking while walking in the embassy. Even there was a guy in my lane outside the main building of Embassy in Isb and some other guy was asking hi something and the first guy responded like man don’t talk here as they observe us through cameras. This is too much.
So be confident while appearing for the interview. Moreover, they didn’t ask me for any extra document apart from the essential and neither I was asked to submit any document via mail. It was a smooth process and got my VISA mere in 7 days. 
Cheers

VO: Pass me your i-20 and passport
Me: Passed
VO: Why are you going to the USA?
Me: I am going to get a degree of master's in data analytics at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico
VO: Why you chose Data Analytics?
Me: 
A few months ago, when I was working, I realized that I am lacking some skills and knowledge of the data analytics domain as my job demand these skills and I am lacking in it that are creating hurdles in my career growth I decided to do a master's in data analytics that would complement my career growth in Pakistan. Moreover, after getting my degree in this major I will prefer to rejoin the company where I am working right now, even if they offered a promotion after the completion of my studies.
VO: How many universities have you applied to?
Me: 
I applied to three universities, which are New Mexico State University, Eastern University, and Jacksonville university, and got acceptance by the NMSU and Eastern University.
VO: Why is New Mexico State University?
Me:  I choose this university for a couple of reasons if you want to know.
1)NMSU is the flagship university of New Mexico.
2)The course curriculum is more advance than the other universities.

Me: Thank you.
Thanks.
Important points you should consider before applying for the F1 visa.
1)If you going for studies in the USA then you have to do the entire process without the support of any consultant, otherwise, your visa will be rejected.
2)You have to be very confident while you are communicating with the visa officer.
3) Your dress matters a lot, always prefer to wear simple and dark-colored clothes for the visa interview.
4)Always try to work on your grooming if you are planning for the visa interview (Beard, Hair Cut, Hair Colour, and Clean Shave) Everything should be up to date.
5) Try to keep a smile on your face while giving the interview.
6) If you do not know how to apply to a US university or even how to apply for a visa then you have to select the other country, USA is not the right place for you. Your input really matters.
7) Stop giving answers in YES or NO (Your answer should be at least one line).
Thank you so much Rana Ibrar and Mahwish Moazzam for your continuous effort and support. That was impossible without your assistance. God Bless you.

I asked her ""Actually my classes are going to start on the 23rd of August.""
She said in an apologetic way ""I am sorry but we have to follow the process""
Also, she gave me back my passport.

Do I have a chance to get a visa in 2-3 months so I can join the spring semester? Because I think the Fall semester is impossible for me?

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Embassy: Islamabad
Status : Approved
Applied by myself
After greeting, VO said my name and I nodded in response
Why are you going to US
I'm going for studies
You're going to Harvard. Great. What are you going to study?
Differential equations
Differential equations?
Yes, my concentration is differential equations although it says liberal arts on the document.
Why do you want to study these?
I'm a teacher and need to learn them so I can teach it to my students.
How was the application process?
(VO was asking about admission application and I thought he meant visa application) Most people said I should get an advisor or counsellor but I did it myself, didn't find it very complicated.
(VO interrupted) 
Did you apply and get accepted for it or just signed up?
I had to apply and go through the admission process.
OK. How do you plan to pay for it?
From my savings.
How much  do you have?
I shared the amount.
Are you married?
Yes
Any kids?
No.
Is your wife going with you?
No she's not. (I wanted to explain why, but didn't)
Have you changed your name before?
No, I haven't.
OK. It says you were Akmal (not real name) before?
My family calls me that endearly. It hasn't been my official name. 
OK I'm approving your visa. You'll get your passport in some days.
I asked how long it will take and he said its on the blue slip.
VO kept typing throughtout these questions and there were long pauses between questions. He didn't ask me for any supporting documents apart from the usual sevis fee, visa fee, DS 160 and Passport.
I was very nervous because he refused 3 people before me and only one approval. At the last minute I told myself that this person is a gatekeeper and I have to go to US nomatterwhat. I focused on why I was there and where I wanted to be, instead of focusing on people around me. Confidence is key. He could have refused me for my ans to last question but I clarified and was confident which I think helped.
ایسا لگ رہا ہے جیسے برسوں کا بوجھ ہٹ گیا ہو۔ 
I was refused visa for UK 4 years ago despite having an offer from University of Cambridge and it took me 3 years to save the money for this program.
I'd like to thank Tahir Haneef for helping me clear my doubts and for questions I had. I'd also like to thank you all for this group and the moderators. I did multiple mock interviews using different questions from previous posts here.
BTW nobody tells you about the whole gruesome process of going to shuttle stop, the exorbitant fee for it, multiple queues and security checks. The embassy building is daunting. Also, from the moment I stepped out of embassy to until I left the shuttle stop, every person I met asked me for mithayi after seeing the blue slip. I hope our workers learn some self respect and stop the begging.

Hi all,
I am J1 applicant. Visa officer took my passport but visa status is refused untill administrative process is completed. My start date is already expired and University provided me new Ds-2019 stating extended joining date. 
To note, embassy did not ask me to submit new ds-2019, yet University sent new form as joining date was exprired. 
My question is, should I send new ds-2019 to embassy even though they did not ask or should I wait for their directions?
Thanks for suggestions.

Sorry for the delayed post. 
I got my visa Approved on the 15th of August. Got my Passport after 15 days.
Islambad Embassy
The Officer was Long beard Guy.
Indiana Institute of Tech
The interview was pretty quick and straightforward.
Who is your sponsor?
Father's business?
How many branches?
How many Employees?
Why Gap?
Have you been to the U.S before?
Is it an Online Institution?
That was about it I guess If I remember correctly. I just wanted to post here because I used to read people's stories and get inspired to an extent so I thought it was my obligation to do the same.
There are no tricks Guys. Just know your stuff.
Read as much as possible about your course, your university, your Gap if any, and your sponsor's business (how many employees, the total income etc). The more you read about your stuff the more confident you will be.
Just be confident, be fluent. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's going to a 2-3 minutes interview that will change your life. 
One more thing, don't think about 2nd attempt. Consider your first attempt the last one and get the visa.
Good Luck!

Embassy location: Karachi
Visa status: Approved on 1st attempt alhamdulillah(Arrived in USA on 28th December 2022)
Interviewer was a short haired blondie on counter 3
***PS. The interview was long as I tried to drag it as much as possible, so I will try to write as much as I can remember bear with the long post I hope it can be helpful***
Me: Hello
VO: Hey, how are you?
Me: I am good, I hope you are doing well too.
VO: thank you, May I have your picture
Me: Sure, here you go?
VO: How much time has passed since you got this captured?
Me: Maybe 2 months or a little over I don’t remember exactly.
VO: Is your picture edited?
Me: Oh yes, I guess it is as I got it taken at a studio
VO: Alright, may I have your documents please?
Me: You mean the bundle they made at first security check?
VO: Yeah that’s the one
Me: Here you go!
VO: Thank you (takes a glance at my documents and started typing away on her computer vigorously)
Me: Pleasure is all mine!
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going for higher studies, masters in civil engineering precisely.
VO: (continues typing while asking) Which university did you applied to?
Me: Oh I applied to 4 universities and got accepted at Lamar university
VO: Where else did you applied to?
Me: I applied at 3 other universities *told the names*, I originally planned to go for bridgeford but the communication with them was not so efficient and Lamar had swift responses so I thought why not!
VO: Can you tell me about your bachelors course?
Me: You mean the whole curriculum or the background of what it was about?
VO: Yeah the background (still focusing on her computer)
***BTW a handful tip try to get the interviewers’ attention because that is actually an indication that she is interested in knowing about you and most likely to grant you a visa so stop making robotic internet responses come up with your own originality***
Me: I explained about my bachelors and research major
VO: Ok so who is funding your studies?
Me: Well ofcorse my father is funding my studies as I am a student and I don’t work plus I also was able to get scholarship on merit basis
VO: What does your father do?
Me: He is a businessman
VO: What kind of business he runs?
Me: Oh he rents out heavy machineries for road carpet finish and supplies bitumen.
VO: Sorry, what bitumen?
Me: Uh you know the finish product of the road, small black rocks used for carpeting the roads.
VO: Oh yeah I got that, so why did you chose civil engineering for masters?
(She was continuously typing at this point too and I was trying to drag the convo as much as I can so she can start talking to me actually face to face)
Me: Ok so the story goes way long back, my father supported and encouraged me a lot regarding my education and such as I have no brother he placed all his expectations on me in this regard and trained me for such so that when I grow up I can help him with the business handling and that’s the reason it became my passion to actually learn about what my father does and to help him improve I wanted to learn about it from a worldly aspect so that we can adapt the technology and methods used around the world.
VO: Oh wow that’s cool!
(She glanced at me and started typing away again and I stood there waiting but seconds felt like hours and it felt like the pause was too long so I started talking again)
Me: While doing my thesis I got lucky and my bachelors research preprint got published too which was a milestone for me.
VO: (finally she leave her computer leaned on the table and turned her whole attention towards me and that felt like an achievement at that moment TBH) Tell me more about it.
Me: So my research was about the airport management at Karachi Jinnah Intl Airport and its aspects.
VO: How is airport management related to what you want to study?
Me: Yeah the infrastructure and management aspect you know.
VO: Ohhh now that’s cool, Congratulations your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you!
***She was giving me the yellow approval slip alongwith my documents bundle from the small window and suddenly stopped either ends of the documents in each of our hands***
VO: When does your classes start?
Me: Oh they start from 17th Jan 2023.
VO: Alright you are free to go
(I took the document and went straight outside without seeing back and out where I cam from in)
***Remember you can be nervous it doesn’t matters because the officers are well aware of that no matter how hard you try to hide it it’s just going to get worse so do not bother with that but don’t lose your composure in the process this is the thing you need to work on. Never ever express your gratitudes and emotions and joyness when your visa gets approved as it is going to convey that you are desperate and most highly chance of getting rejected because they can do it that is what they are checking from the very beginning till the end, they are not interested in you because of all those robotic answers they hear all day long so make them actually talk to you, and last but not the least recite some duas for ease all the time on the way to the embassy till you stand in front of the interviewer, don’t think about acception or rejection that’s the main thing and you will automatically start to talk without any hesitation***
That’s all for now if you have any further questions feel free to ring my inbox and best of luck for thise who have upcoming interviews believe in Allah have faith in yourself and ace the interview afterall you are paying a hefty amount just to get to talk with the person and still you have to be nervous from thise who are taking your money, give yourself a prep talk and you are good to go.

Interview experience. F1 visa. Karachi Embassy.
Alhamdulillah got my visa approved.
They only asked for my DS 160 confirmation,SEVIS, I20 and most recent passport at the entrance. Visa officer also checked only these. Didn't ask for anything else.
VO: 
Morning
Me: Morning
Then he asked for the finger-scanning. I did it. Then he asked the first question.
Why MBA?
I was about to answer and he interrupted, ""something went wrong with prints, we will have to repeat.""
This did throw me a bit as it disrupted my thoughts flow. But I scanned my fingers again and then he repeated same question.
VO: Why MBA?
Me: I answered, it was based on personal details.
VO: Why this university?
Me: Multiple reasons. It has really good marketing program, something I am interested in majoring. It also has a cool academies program. Where students get one to one mentorship and get to work on real life business cases. Also it's somewhere I have previously attended a summer exchange program at 6 years ago. And finally, they give a really good financial aid package.
VO: (Looked at my I20). So who is paying for it?
Me: Like I said I have really good financial aid package. And for the rest I have taken out a student loan.
VO: Did you get the loan from Pakistan?
Me: No, prodigy finance.
VO: Based on what information did they approve your loan?
Me: Oh just my employment history, bank history and credit score.
VO: Do you have friends or family in USA?
Me: No, first one from my family to be going there.
VO: That's nice.
Then he typed for like a full minute or 2 which felt like ages and then said, congratulations, your visa has been approved. You will get an email when your passport is ready to be collected.
He also handed me a yellow slip saying my visa is approved and how will I collect it.
PS:. From what I read here, I thought yellow was administrative processing and blue was approval. But approval is yellow.

Me: I had applied in four universities (Named all of it) and got two acceptances. I have another I20 if you like to see.
Vo: No, Why you choose this university?
Me: Actually I was looking for two to three things while selecting the university. Like the course structure, faculty members and the research facilities. (Vo interrupted)
Vo: It is almost hunderd thousand dollars for your two years, who is going to pay it?
Me: My Father (Told her a little bit about my fathers business)
Vo: I know you are a genuine student but it is very hard to pay US university fee. So, I am sorry I can't approve your  visa.
Lesson Learned:
- Sponsers financial credibility was not addressed properly

THIRD ATTEMPT
Same Profile 
Interview date: 14th Dec
Class start date: 11th Jan
VO was a young male.
Me: Hello 
Vo: Hello
(While passing the documents)
Vo: Why are you going to USA?
Me: I am going to do Masters in Civil Engineering at Texas Tech University.
Vo: Have you applied before? (Meanwhile he was removing the bandage over my documents)
Me: Yes actually its my third appearance, i have been refused twice before.
Vo: (The moment he listen this he turn the bandage back on and started typing and asked) what have you changed in your profile?
Me: Actually I am very confident about my profile and I believe there must be some misunderstanding due   to which I couldn't satisfy the visa officer.
Vo: (Aggressively) First of all your confidence is not enough and secondly I don't believe there was any misunderstanding because your english is very good and your presenting yourself very well.
Me: Sir I am also flabbergasted that what is happening for the last two times, there must have been some communication gap.
Vo: If it seems to you that some officers are older and have better judgement and the younger one's doesn't. You are wrong, we all have the same training and judgment skills. Last time you appeared 13 days before, am I right?
Me: Yes
Vo: (Passed me the yellow slip and took his keyboard aside and get his mike near to mouth and spoke with very harsh behavior that) 
Let me explain you the F1 visa process. It is not a lottery that you are applying again and again. I am not saying zero (while making the hand gesture) but there are 99.99 percent chances that your visa is going to be refused until or unless some major changing happens in your profile. So, I'll suggest you to not waste your money by applying again and again. 
Lesson Learned:
- It was just not my day.
______________________________________________
FORTH ATTEMPT
Interview date: 11th Jan
Class start date: 11th Jan
Didn't have late arrival letter.
VO was a Beard Guy.
Me: Hello Sir How are you?
Vo: I am fine, how are you?
Me: I am good.
Vo: Ok, why are you going to USA?
Me: I am going to do Masters in Civil Engineering at Texas Tech University. 
Vo: Have you applied in any other university?
Me: Yes i did apply in four other universities (named all of them) and got two acceptances. I have another I20 if you like to see.
Vo: No, Who is your sponsor and what does he do?
Me: Told in detail
Vo: How many siblings do you have?
Me: I have one elder brother who is a doctor by profession and a younger sister who just engaged last week and going to be married soon. So, ultimately I am the only dependent child of my parents.
Vo: You work at xyz company, what is your role there?
Me: Told
Vo: (asked another question I don't remember)
Me: I replied to that question  and in addition I also mention him that the reason why I am emphasizing again and again on going to USA is because being a Civil Engineer I know that in Pakistan we follow the American Building Codes and American Standard Testing Machines, so it would be completely waste of time and money for me to consider other country as my post-grad destination.
Vo: (Already started typing) Ok you make sense to me. I am approving you visa and passed me the blue slip.
Lesson Learned:
- Don't loose hope.
I know all of us are fighting our untold battles due to which more often we experience anxiety attacks which sometimes even lead us to the feelings of existential crisis. I would say don't get your energies drained by mere affairs of this materialistic world. What happens, it has to happen. Trust the procedure.......I do know its cliche to say all of this but i hope this approch might help one day.

Congrats, I am approving your visa! 
I was shocked at what is happening...
VO already rejected 4 students in front of me after a full detailed interview..
And I want to tell you one thing interesting ... I was in the line where VO was a lady and she was rejecting everyone and rejecting 4,5 students already...When she calls me for an interview I skipped the line...Their security officer asked me why I skip the line?. I said I feel hesitant in front of the lady officer 
...He said okayy and allow me to give my interview to the male Visa officer..
It was quick barely 2 minutes. I was prepared and confident enough. 
Serious suggestion:- Be confident with a smiling face and don't hesitate... VO wants to give VISA if you are confident...
Thanks...

Subject = Master in Health care management. .
Details.
I am a  nurse by profession, 
I 
told my consultant that I need to get admission in  Master of science in Nursing , My consultant satisfied me that he will get my admission easily, because I have a strong profile, then I was a gree and deposit money ,but after two months my consultant told me that getting admission in master in nursing is impossible for Pakistani students, I was in shock to hear,My consultant then told me that I have only option to take admission in (master in health care management) so I decided to say yes because I have no any other option .
When my I 20 form release by university they mentioned my major is MBA , when I ask from my consultant does it make Sense because my major is Master in health care management, My consultant told me that don't wory master in health care management come under MBA category.
During today interview my interviewer ask me
My major is MBA , which is mentioned in I 20  form.
I justify my Answer that I am going to persue master in health care management which come under the MBA category, 
But the expression of interviewer changed and give me yellow slip .
So I request those all students ,please don't go to any consultancy ,they have only one aim to grab your money , they don't care about your future it all.
Because if your subject is changed from your previous degree then it doesn't make sense to the interviewer that you are a genuine student ,because they need a weak point in your profile to reject you easily.

He gave a smile, seemed like he thought i was confident abt my program like know how, and stood up took my passport inside and came back
Him:Why this university?
 I did an internship at an educational consultancy where i got to know about university of UTAH then i did my research and got to know about unique majors that university is providing and big campus situated in 1526 acres, diversification of students, support system for students, i got scholarship of 35000$ across 4 years and last factor was location, which is salt lake city, it is one of the liveable cities in US and top preference for international student because of the business opportunities.

US visa interview Analysis
I have been reading posts from students getting visa rejections. Generally there are lot of common red flags that even we are able to spot. 
When it comes to visa interview, first of all your whole picture is important. That includes your body language, your confidence and positivity, and your clear and concise communication. 
For starters, don’t fear the rejection and be hopeful, trust yourself if you have done your homework well. Don’t try to flatter 
or give long answers, only tell what are you asked and answer the question directly, no hereabouts or background stories. Communicate very clearly so that they are able to hear and understand you.
This was about communication and first impressions. Now, for the interview there are certain things that every visa officer wants to know. 
I made an easy to remember guide. Have you consider what can be 3 C’s for a visa interview? Have you wondered what visa officers are actually assessing? It’s only 3 things, and all their questions revolve around these.
The 3 C’s of visa interview: Credibility, cost and commitment 
Credibility means you have to establish that you are a genuine student, have study related goals, and your profile is sound. The university you chose suits your educational needs and is not just a random university to get a way out. You are not hiding anything, and you are showing exactly who you are. 
To sum up, your academic profile, your spoken skills, and the university you chose matters a lot
Cost means that you are financially secure and able to fund your studies. This part becomes easier if you have a fully funded scholarship. In all other cases you need to show a strong financial sponsorship which is legitimate. Your immediate family members can sponsor you and they should seem reasonably strong themselves to be able to support. Sponsorship from other relatives and a mismatch between the financial condition of sponsor and the bank statement becomes shady.
Lastly, commitment is the most important C, you won’t be able to dodge that easily. Commitment to your own self, your country and the US law. Commitment to yourself means you are passionate about your work and have sincere plans, you are not willing to use the education as an opportunity to run away from your area of study and choose something else when land in US. Commitment to the country, Meaning you have to show strong ties with your country and that you want to come back, you having a family or job back home is a good tie but that’s not enough. Make no mistake and keep your mind off of additional thoughts, VO will know if you are being tricky.
Last thing is commitment to law, sadly many students get involved in illegal jobs to support themselves or use petty tactics to get a citizenship and settle in the other country. This is in a violation of your visa status and VOs will read that. So be a responsible citizen and don’t show such signs in interview.
I will be hosting a live drop in session tomorrow evening in this group. Will be sharing these in more details and answer your questions if any.
All the best

Seniors
, please help me out in this matter. I really appreciate any help you can provide.
I applied for an F1 visa but got rejected in my first attempt. I'm going to try again, but I'm also engaged with a girl who has US citizen and could apply for a spouse visa. I still want to try for the F1 visa first. If I don't get it after two attempts, will it create any problem when I will apply for a different visa based on my spouse's sponsorship?
Thanks Again.

Hello All
I gave my visa interview for PhD on July 18
Case created: july 18
Case last  updated; july 19
Status: refused
Due 
to administrative processing 
VO asked me to submit additional documents like CV, study plan etc.which I submit within 2 days.
Since then my Visa status is refused.
I defer my semester as my classes start date was 28th August which I couldn't attend.
Can I book appointment again ? Or 
Should I wait for this administrative processing? 
Can anybody Please guide me.
"
215,"
Visa approved after 221g (administrative processing)
AOA
I finally received a visa after 40 days of administrative processing.
University: Cleveland State University
Sponsor: Cousin living in the US
Embassy: Islamabad
Interview date: 03 Aug 2022
Passport received: 20 Sep 2022
Interview experience: VO only asked about my program and current job while constantly typing. He was not asking anything else but just typing, I was telling him about my graduation, sponsor and future goals. He was just saying OK in reply. He then told me he will need some more information via email and returned my passport.
So, i want to share my experience what observed so far, it might be helpful for someone.
First and the most important thing is the believe in Allah and Duas from parents.
Practice interview in front of a mirror or laptop camera.
Prepare the answers to common questions from VO and analyze them until you get confidence that they are according to your case because only you know the best about yourself. Tell him like a story and show your accomplishments. No doubt, university and sponsorship matter but the most important thing that matters is how you are presenting your case if it makes sense then all OK. Your whole profile matter.
One last important thing which we often ignore, please be dressed as it depicts how serious you are about your study or the concerned post. They judge you from the very moment when you get up from the chair and move towards the window.
Best of luck all.
Thanks!

Karachi Consulate 
23rd November 
VO was Asian American
VO: 
Please pass your documents (passport and I20)
VO: Have you been to the US before?
Yes I went there with my family couple of years back.
VO: Why do you want to go now?
I want to pursue a master's degree in xyz program for abc university. 
VO: Why this program?
It is a growing field and related to my undergraduate degree as well as current job. 
VO: Who is your sponsor?
My sponsor is xyz and he has a business based in pakistan. (Gave some details of his business here to avoid usual follow up questions regarding sponsor. 
VO: Your visa is approved. 
The interview was of one minute at max. I had an upper hand because of being a issued a tourist visa earlier but most people were getting accepted that day. 
A few pointers for people who would be applying:
- Aim for universities that have a QS ranking of under 500. 
- Apply to multiple universities (3-5) as it shows the student's interest in studying. 
- Try applying to a field that is related to your current work experience or undergraduate degree. 
All they really see is the student's authenticity and his ability to come back after studies. If they have any doubt about the student staying there or going to earn money, they will reject your visa. 
All the best, may Allah make the process easy for everyone.

Embassy: Islamabad
Date: 12 May
Visa Status: Approved
I was a bit nervous and none of my answers went 100% smooth.
Here's how interview went.
VO: Hello(in very friendly tone)
Me: Hi
VO: (After taking my docs and entering them on PC) Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going to attend Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Cincinnati.
VO: (After a pause) Why did you choose this University?
Me: (I stuttered during this answer a bit) I am going because this university is aligned with my research interest.
VO: Why did you choose University of Cincinnati specifically?
Me: Because the lab facilities and faculty is suited to my research in additive manufacturing. It's the same research that I did in my bachelor's. (stuttered here too)
VO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father. (I stopped after saying this for around 20 secs and then started speaking again) He is manager at X and makes Y money through job Z money through rentals and some money thru real estate trading which I don't know how much is.
VO: Cograts. Enjoy your stay at united states.
Me: Thanks.
Thoughts? 
The visa doesn't mostly depend on the interview. The VO wasn't even listening to me with attention. It depends on your uni, course and any funding you have(I had $20k scholarship). My interview wasn't the best. Actually, I would say it was average or below average.
Almost all visas(5/5) got approved before me. Only 2 were refused, who went after me. Those 2 had genuine reasons to refuse. If I were VO, I would even refuse them(not cuz of hate lol but their case didn't seem strong on paper)
Suggestions?
1. Don't go for consultants. They apply for you at few unis which VOs are aware of. VOs don't even consider you in that case. They straight away reject you.
2. Take IELTS. Take GRE. Secure full/partial scholarship(you can easily get it). Then go for visa. You will get it InshAllah.

Interview date = 15 Aug
Status = approved 
V.O= long beard man
Time slot = 10.30 am
First Question = how many admits you got
Answer = i got admission in 3 out of 4 universities in which i applied. Unfortunately wasn’t able to make it to university of rochester. Also named the universities and their business schools in which i got admit
2nd = why this xyz university 
Ans= Told MSBA at xyz is ranked among top 100 MsBa programs in the world according to Qs rankings. Also told in detail about the diversity of curriculum 
3rd= how many brothers you have
Ans = told 1 and also about his profession
4Th= who is financing you
Ans= told i have got scholarship of about 5K and have personal savings of around 8k and the rest of cost which is almost 43 k is going to be paid by my father. 
He asked about his business and i gave him the details 
5th= he asked me about my mother’s sister who lives in US
Ans= i told him that i have no immediate relative but about other relatives I already had mentioned in my Ds-160. He didn’t bother about it because she lives in different state than the state in which I have got acceptance..
Conclusion = 
Before the start of interview i had got the confidence that I would get visa because VO gave quite time to a student before me and listened him comprehensively before rejecting his visa so i got the feeling that if he gives me that chance i ll have the chances to get the visa. No doubt it is game of luck . And also the VO who is quite young was also giving alot of opportunity to speak . Women VO had more interviews from non-F1 categories and she put most of these cases to administration processing

US F-1 Visa:
I had my Visa interview on 7th October. The interviewer gave me a Blue slip(Visa Approved) and said my Visa was approved and I should get my Visa in 7 days. It's more than a week now and I haven't received my Visa. Moreover, my status on CEAC website is 'Administrative processing'.And the last status update date is same as the interview date.
On the other hand some friends of mine who had Visa interview after 13th October, have received emails about their Visa 
delivery and their status on the CEAC website is 'ISSUED'
I am worried about it now because I have to enter US before 1st November according to the start date mentioned on my I-20. Does anyone have any idea about how much more time this Visa process can take?
Note: My Visa was approved and Interviewer himself told me that I shoul get the Visa in 7 days.

VO: What kind of art does your father do?

VO: Hmm...
VO: What will you do after completing your filmmaking degree?
Me: I will come back to Pakistan because I see a big gap that needs to be filled in here in the Pakistani film industry, everyone is working on genres like romance and comedy, but no one is working on Sci-Fi or classic drama. I wish to bring all of the knowledge and techniques of advanced filmmaking to Pakistan so that I could create projects to uplift the under-developing film industry of Pakistan.

I had my F1 visa interview on 29th March 2021. Although I got the visa approval slip (blue color) from the VO, my online visa checker shows the status of 'Refused'. I have already emailed this query to the embassy but still no response. Anybody else having the same issue? If yes, what is the possible solution and how can I check my true status?

My Visa is refused under 221g on 20th May and they require some additional documents. I submit the documents on 24th of May and I received an Auto response from the embassy attached below.
I think it's due the political protests in Islamabad in those days.
*Should I submit them documents again? Or they will consider my previous email.*

INTERVIEWER: INFAMOUS ASIAN
NO GRE
NO IELTS
GPA 2.86
Date: 8th June.
DISCLAIMER: My interview was very different from others so please don't take it as a guide as I don't want to mislead anyone.
After preparing myself for straight 20 days I went for an Interview, I was prepared for every kind of question, but there was something else written in my fate.
VO DID NOT ASK ANY COMMON QUESTIONS LIKE:
Why US? 
Why this university?
Rather he started like this
1) what are your daily responsibilities in your current job?
2) what does your father do? (Convinced with my one word ANSWER)
3) what are your plans after graduation? (Told him the names of 3 it companies name where I'm aiming to work at)
4) do you have any relatives? I said yes because I didn't want to lie
5) will you leave the current job? I said yes (btw I just joined that job 20 days ago)
Conclusion: All that time he was behaving as if the decision is already decided because he seemed too uninterested to hear my answers. It was like as if he was just completing a formality nothing else.
In a nutshell, for me US F1 VISA IS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON LUCK BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A HEC FUNDED PHD LEVEL GUY GETTING REJECTED WHOSE PROFILE WAS 4X STRONGER THAN MINE.
BUT GO WELL PREPARED AND BE CONFIDENT. I ALSO GREETED HIM IN A VERY LOUD VOICE. Also don't forget to pray and take your mother's prayers as they can do wonders.
GOODLUCK!
Thankyou 
Rana Ibrar
 for helping me throughout this journey.

J1 and J2 visa 
#approved
J1 for the postdoc position at UW, Seattle
Took interview on 1st December along with two dependents (spouse and a 20-mo old toddler) at Isl Embassy 
Fingerprints were taken by a man who did ask about the height of spouse.
VO was a young lady 
J1 Interview questions were related to research focus during postdoc, funding from the supervisor, previous PhD research experience. Documents asked resume of j1, and postdoc supervisor along with research plan and offer letter
J2 interview questions were related to current job position in Pakistan, PhD research work and PhD funding (which was by Iran and we both did our PhD from Tehran University of Medical Sciences)
J2 toddler slept during the interview after throwing major tantrum before the interview.
J1 and J2 toddler's passport was kept by the visa officer. Ds2019 was signed and returned. No documents asked. Just told to wait.
J2 spouse's passport was returned back. He was given a slip with a QR code to be scanned asking for further documentation.
It referred to ds5535 which has major qs related to travel history.
J1 and the toddler got approved after 6 working days. No docs asked.
J2 spouse was approved 3 weeks after the approval of primary applicant.
J1 requested an updated ds2019 from the supervisor as the old one was no longer valid.
All this happened from 1 Dec to 15 Jan. I am bad at keeping dates for individual updates of the status history.

If you dont get accepted in US in the first try, rather than begging them in 2nd or 3rd try for a visa , just change your country because some of us are not born with silver spoons in our mouth , nor have any businesses to show ties.

She was a young American lady, we had a conversation for like 2 -3 minutes.

** I was being honest but I think that was a big mistake too because my brother has not visited pakistan since he went ( almost 2 years) but he's visiting next month now.
After that she gave me Yellow slip and said sorry can't give you visa due to immigration rules.
Now I have applied again this week at Karachi Embassy with the same profile ( DS160, Queens college NY, same course bachelor's in computer science) because I think I made mistakes in siblings section.
I need help and Answers , Where I was wrong and what changes should I make , I know this time officer is also going to ask me why was my VISA refused and what circumstances have you changed.
Your Answers can help me alot
Thanks 
Best of luck to all of you

Visa Category: F-1 Student Visa
Timing: 8:45am
Date: 09-12-2022
Counter no 4
Visa 
officer: Young American Lady.
Status: Visa Approved
Special Case: My Uncle in USA was my sponsor
IELTS: Band 8
Academics: A and O Level with 7 papers of ACCA all above 82% marks
University: University of Nebraska-Lincoln
No Greetings or Good morning
VO: Straight away, Pass me your documents
Me: Given
VO: Why are you going to USA
Me: I'm going to pursue further education in USA which is an Undergraduate Degree.
VO: Why specifically USA and were you looking for other destinations?
Me: I choose USA, since Australia is more expensive in terms of living cost and Canada doesn't have high quality education in comparison to USA. Additionally, USA has the most number of prestigious universities. Also, these universities offer practical courses with flexible education for students and cultural diversity in USA further enhances the educational experience. She then interrupted
VO: Why are you not continuing your ACCA in Pakistan and instead going for a Degree in USA.
Me: Firstly ACCA is a professional qualification and not a degree. personally I feel that ACCA is just the pure education,meanwhile a degree in USA will not only avail me with practical education but also enhance my communication skills as well. Secondly, I designed my career path in such a way that after getting this degree from USA, I will be eligible to get exemption of 6 papers from Pakistan so that's why I decided to pursue my education in USA and then complete ACCA after coming back to Pakistan.
VO: Why did you select this university?
Me: I conducted a whole research and I have a set of parameters through which I filtered a handful of universities and then finalized this one. Most important reason beside its high ranking in USA is it's accounting course structure.
VO: Then tell me something about this course, have you gone through the course catalog?
Me: The course speciality is that, it is divided into semester and each semester is based on two modules. Each module represents a skill set, so unlike other courses where we learn core accounting skills in last 2 years, this degree allows me to learn all these skills on the go from first year to last. And yes I have gone through course catalog as well.
VO: So what subjects are you really excited about from that course catalog
Me: I'm interested in Performance Management, Financial Reporting, Cost Accounting. After that She was typing in Keyboard then I said, I'm extremely passionate about accounting systems as well.
VO: Who is going to sponsor you?
Me: My Uncle is going to sponsor me, He own a business named HCGeeks.
VO:Tell me more about his business.
Me: He has an IT support business which offer multiple services like website designing, repair and maintenance... She interrupted me and ask another question.
VO: What did your father do and Why doesn't he sponsored you?
Me: My fathers owns a Gold Wholesale Business. This business is too traditional and all the payments and receipt are made in Gold. That's why my father was unable to provide a Bank Statement in Cash for last six months. Therefore, I'm using my uncle's bank statement as a proof of funds and he will be responsible to finance my entire stay in USA.
VO: Did your uncle have any dependent in USA?
Me: Yes he live with his family and have 2 daughters and a Son.
VO: Then How will he support Your education while looking for his family as well?
Me: All his children are under 12 years of age so by the time when he actually begins to finance the education of his children, my education will be finished till that time.
VO: Did you have any siblings?
Me: Yes, I have 2 sister and a brother. I'm the eldest.
VO: What are your future plans and how this degree will help?
Me: This degree is a milestone in itself, since it fulfils the credit hour requirement towards a professional qualification. So with the planned career path,In next 10 years I want to have at least 2 degrees, along with a professional accounting qualification. I envision myself working as the head of department or in a managerial position in relevant accounting firm.
VO: Did you meet any student of this university  or contacted professor?
Me: No, I wasn't in contact with student but I call their representative once to resolve one issue.
VO: I'm accepting Your Visa and She handed me a Yellow Slip.
Me: Thank You.
Tears were literally bubbling out of my eyes. As I was sitting in the waiting area after acceptance, two ladies thought that I was crying because I get rejected but then I showed them the acceptance slip. That was the moment of my life.
I was fully confident, the interview was very long around 10-13min and the Visa officer asked me lots of unorthodox questions, with every question she used to stare at me with sharp eyes but I maintained eye contact and was using my hand as well while replying to her questions.
I prepared a lot for this interview and I used to visualize myself in this condition. Every thing went very smooth and I tackled every single question without hesitation.
One tip is to make a possible list of question, then try to write a general answer first and then personalize that answer. It should sound that It's coming from a dedicated student have done his preparation and he cares about his future education.
Hope it helps.
JazakAllah

Hi guys, My visa was refused on 31 Jan the worst day of my life. I was not expecting that I was sure that I am a genuine student and that my profile is so strong my visa will not be refused but it is. I went into depression and couldn't even talk to my parents for a few days then I decided I am not gonna try again. I should switch to Australia and apply there. And I was scared that maybe my Australian visa will be refused because my USA visa is refused. I contacted many 
consultants they said It's not a big deal. I asked a few questions in this group and came to know that it's not a big deal many students got visas on the second attempt. So I gathered information from everyone and came to the point I should try again for the USA. because if my Australian visa is refused there will be no chance that my USA visa will be approved. So I defer my semester to fall 2023. So I want to know from you guys What I should change to my application?
Should I change university? All other students who applied to that uni got visa approval, not even a single one got a refusal.
Should I add another sponsor along with my father?
Those guys who got approval after rejection please tell me what you guys did.
Lastly, I want to tell you to say your interview did not go well which may be the reason. But my interview lasted for 15 minutes and I answered everything. But when I posted my experience in this group I realized that I made 1 to 2 mistakes but that's not a reason for refusal.

“ FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANTS TO APPLY FOR USA STUDENT VISA” 
I got all of questions in my inbox regarding US student visa so thought should write here to cater most audience. 
This text is divided into: Expense before and after getting visa, Visa approval and denial etc. 
Firstly, When you start planning to get your degree there are some of the cost you should keep in your mind.  
1: IELTS (40,000) approx
2: University Application Fees ( approx 30,000- 40,000) 
3: SEVIS ($350 -  50,000)
4: WES evaluation ($200 - 35,000) approx
5: Visa fees ( $160 - 29,000) 
Approximately one should have around 200,000 thousands (2 lac) in hand because these all fees are in dollars and varies with exchange rates. 
* THIS IS WHEN YOU ARE APPLYING ON YOUR OWN WITHOUT ANY CONSULTANT* 
Secondly, Visa is all about your luck. I have been rejected once and accepted in my next interview. I have changed nothing in filling out DS-160 for my second interview. It was luck that was with me that day but that doesn’t mean I didnt prepared. 
I prepared infront of mirror, practice to speak because english is our secondary language so to clear my pronunciation and to be confident I practice alot. I did mock interview from youtube. Read interviews of people. Make my own notes and keep changing it until I was fully sure about it. Thats how I manage to speak with confident. No matter if you are saying wrong or incorrect if you have confident you are good to go. 
I have seen people accepting and rejecting and be ready for any decision and if you didnt make it first time make sure that you give your 100% in your second attempt so that you dont have any doubt over yourself. 
People asked me that this amount or that amount is enough for our bank statement. I personaly believe amount should be minimum (50 lac) in your or your sponsor account to match the cost of attendance for your university. 
In my case my uncle was my sponsor. No matter eho is your sponsor make sure to prove the ties with that person in your interview. Make your point strong of wht that person is sponsoring you. Every case is different so make sure you have your point. 
You are allowed to work 20 hours a week on campus as a student. This amount is enough to bear your daily expense but with this amount you cant bear your tuition. Keep this in mind. 
 If you get visa make sure you have enough money for atleast 2- 3 month of your expense here in US. This includes your food, traveling, daily expense etc. 
Belive in yourself and Allah. If he have made you to embassy  so trust me your luck is with yoi because yoi are one in those thousand people who are selected to that university. 
*MY MOM USE TO SAY ME*
“BETA, Agar tumhare naseeb main jana likha hai tou koi rook nahin sakta or nahi likha tou koi cha kar bhe nahin bhej sakta* 
 Please write down your wuestion below in comment I will try my best to answer them. 
Thanks.

VO: So why do you want to go to USA?
Me: 
To Persue data sciences from XYZ university
VO: persue?
Me: I mean I want to study data sciences.
VO: why specifically US?
Me: because i see degrees from US highly compatible and respected in Pakistani corporate sector, alot of CEOs and department leads here have graduated from USA. Same is the case at my current organisation, and i want to follow the same career path. 
VO: did you change anything in your application this time?
Me: Yes, i have this job conditional confirmation letter from my current organisation, (I pushed it forward) do you wanna see it?
VO: (He didn't take it) Can you please tell me about it with some details?
Me: Sure, its a conditional letter where I have to complete my masters specific to only data sciences/analysis. And they will onboard me back at a senior position. 
VO: Oh great (when he said this I had my hopes up)
VO kept typing for 2-3 mins, i was expecting him to ask more questions based on my sponser and finances.
VO: unfortunately we cannot grant you visa, please do read it out(passed me the same slip)
Me: is there anything specific i can change if I'm applying again?
VO: all i can tell you is mentioned in this (pointed at the slip)
Me: I read it out very carefully the first time too. But sure, thankyou.
VO: you're welcome (gave me the pity smile lol)
I can't understand what to change, I have academic travel history, i showed strong ties with a standing job offer in Pakistan on my second attempt. Is there anything i can change, I will obviously change my university with a much better ranked one for the next term. But will this change be enough?
Should i go for the 3rd attempt this term? My classes starts on 29th August

VO: Why are you going to the US?
ME: To pursue my masters degree in Human Resource Management from Northeastern University in Boston.
VO: Did you apply to any other universities?
ME: Yes, I applied to two other universities. Boston University and University of Notre Dame, in Indiana. 
VO: Were you accepted to any of those?
ME: I was rejected by Notre Dame but accepted into Boston University.
VO: Have you ever travelled abroad?
ME: No, I haven't
VO: So you have a brother in the US?
ME: Yes, my brother lives in US. He is also a graduate of Northeastern University. And is currently working there in a company. 
VO: Why did you choose to pursue this program now?
ME: Well I graduated last year with my bachelors degree. Since then I've been working in a school as an English teacher. I was made HOD of the English department & I became interested in HR management. And since there weren't many good options for this degree in Pakistan, I thought why not go to the US.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME: My father is my sponsor.
VO: What does your sponsor do?
ME: He is a recently retired police officer from Punjab police. He currently owns a pharmacy business in Lahore.
VO: Ok, I'm approving your visa. 
I found the VO to be very professional. He would interrupt most my answers by saying ""Ok got it"" when he wanted me to stop talking and I would. I was honest and confident. That's the key. Also your choice of University really matters, in my opinion. 
3 guys were rejected before me. 1 girl who went before me was approved.  They were all re-applying. This was my first attempt.

The guy at the finger printing area also asked if I ever changed my name. I said I did not. I’m not sure if this could mean something more..

Date: 24th May 2022
Status : Approved
First, outside the embassy at the window submitted my I-20, Passport, Photograph, I-20 payment slip. 
Secondly, went inside, gave my fingerprints and documents on two windows and then waited for my turn.
Thirdly, THE INTERVIEW
Questions of VO:
What program did you apply to?
How many universities did you apply to?
Who will sponsor your education?
How many siblings do you have?
Is any of your sibling abroad for studying?
What is their status in USA? (My brother is in USA)
Did you get any scholarship?
So these were the questions, to which I answered honestly, I believe they keep cross-checking you for lies because they could have asked a lot of questions regarding my degree but chose to ask for the family history. There was nothing to lie about.
Alhumdulillah !!

Interview Tip
According to EX Visa Officer.
The most important thing to have for your visa interview to be prepared is to have confidence. I would say 30 to 50 per cent of your visa approval or denied based on confidence so you want to make sure that you have that confidence.
 
How do you get that confidence?
You have to know exactly what kinds of questions will come up for your specific life situation. So prepare well for all the possible life scenarios. Throughout the interview, try to stay as positive as possible so that you appear polite, calm, and relaxed.

2. University of Texas Austin Mccombs (MBA) accepted 
3. Michigan Ross (MBA) decision waiting.
Do you think I should move to US and let go my canadian PR? Will I be able to settle down in the US.

VO: Ok so, you can take these documents back and we've approved your visa. (Passed me the blue slip while smiling)
Me: thank you. (Smiled back)
VO: Enjoy your stay with your family. (Said happily)
( For most of the time, she kept looking and typing at the screen. Didn't look at me for longer than a second or two during each of my answers. Also my answers were brief and to the point so she didn't have to look for long either.
I kept an eye contact during the whole interview and also maintained a bit smile throughout my interview though it went quite long and I had to wait a lot in between too.
I had a plus point of already having a visit visa so I used that in start while answering the question of why I chose that uni. As I heard that the VO may have not gone through all your data so you should convey them such info yourself.
Though my answers were not in detail but i did prepare myself for any type of detail. I made a list of all possible questions and prepared the detailed answers then filtered out the important information only.  Saved the detail for only the case if they themselves ask me to go into.
You should definitely have all the information about the university you're applying to. They should not get the idea that you've selected a university without doing any proper research)

Hello,
I am from Pakistan. I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s Masters program, and received a financial aid award that does not cover personal, food and travel expenses (along with other services and amenities). I wanted to write here to ask about alternative sources of funding (both International/American and Pakistani) that could help me finance my graduate study in the United States/at Bard and cover the remaining costs. I have spoken to their financial aid 
officer, but thought it might be worth a shot, to ask here and get your suggestions. 
Thank you very much.

These questions are so simple but in a way its more difficult for those students who are feeling hesitation in front of visa officer.
So the thing all students have to do is Just be confident and look in the eyes of the visa officer. Don’t lie about anything, they already have your background data and talk to them what they ask in simple words. 
Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

Hello everyone,
I got my visa approved, but have received this message after some time:
A U.S. consular officer has adjudicated and refused your visa application. Please follow any instructions provided by the consular officer. If you were informed by the consular officer that your case was refused for administrative processing, your case will remain refused while undergoing such processing. You will receive another adjudication once such processing is complete. Please be 
advised that the processing time varies and that you will be contacted if additional information is needed.
What are the possible outcomes of this? Can anyone please guide?

Hello Everyone, I am sharing my experience of todays visa interview.
Date: November 7, 2022
VISA Rejected 
VO 
was female and was rejecting most of the candidates and i am pretty sure she was annoyed with the behaviour of candidates she was rejecting. 
She requested the documents i.e, passport and F1 with out any greetings.
VO: why do you want to go to US
Me: To complete my master from sanit paul state university.
VO: Where is that ? 
Me: Minnesota
VO: How did you find it ? 
Me: A senior colleague who us working in my company has completed the same program and he referred it to me. 
VO: Have you applied to any other university?
Me: No, I only applied to this university.
VO: who is sponsoring you ?
Me: I am sponsoring myself, i have been working from more than 9 years and on side i also trade cars. These are some of my investments that I have liquidated for my education.
VO: Have you ever travelled before?
Me : Yes 
VO: which countries?
Me: Turkey and Malaysia.
VO: where do you work ?
ME: I am working in XYZ company.
VO: what is your position?
ME: I am working as a ____ Manager
VO: any of your family member have completed a degree from USA?
Me: Yes, my cousin has compelted the degree from California state university.
VO: I am sorry you are not eligible, and handed me the yellow letter.
She didn’t even ask me to show the financial documents or any other documents. I am not sure where did I do wrong. What should I do ? Should I apply for 2nd attempt right away or wait ? Also do i have to change anything in DS-160 ?

Few basic recommendations for US Visa interview, how to fill ds160 and mistakes to avoid.
 Make sure your DS160 replicates your i20. 
( i.e. If you are going for masters which is normally for 2 years and you are planning to complete it in 1.5 years then you still need to put the same program completion date, which is in your i20.)
( 
i.e. whatever program name is written on your i20, write the same in DS160 form as well. Like: if it is Marketing/Marketing Management/ General 52.4527.36 then write exactly the same in ds160 rather than just Marketing.)
 Make sure you fill the ds160 form by yourself and from one location. Even if you have hired consultant, fill it by yourself. Don’t give your consultant access of it. Just ask consultant for help if stuck on any question. Because at the end of ds160, there is a question that did you get help from anyone while filling this form? When consultant fills it for you and select No, and when Officer checks the ip address and it matches the consultanting firm location, it shows that you are lying, then they won’t believe a single word you utter(even though if it is true.) 
 If refused before then simply type in refusal box that you were refused for F1 visa under section 214b on xyz date, month, and year. That is it. No need to write stories. 
 If refused before, don’t change the college in 2nd attempt because it contradicts what you said about the college chosen in first attempt and shows you were not serious about it and you just chose that college because of consultant. If it was community college then it makes sense to change it because VO’s are tough with candidates who went with community college because it is easy to get into it. 
If asked, what have you changed in your profile? Never say nothing, I repeat Never. You have to say Yes and then it just depends upon case to case how you answer.
 When asked any question, don’t give one word answer. You also don’t need to exaggerate.
(I.e. if asked about sponsor and you father is your sponsor then your answer should be something like: My father will be my sponsor, he is a businessman and does a business of xyz and he is being doing that for xyz years. Don’t make them dig info out of you. If given opportunity tell them about it. I repeat, don’t exaggerate.
 Those who have shown off on their Daddy’s cash and uploaded something on social media that is violent like: holding a gun then delete it.
 There is no color concept when it comes to slip you get!
 Finally, luck does matter. (But not when you beg them to refuse you) 
Good Luck.

Hello everyone,
Location: Europe
Visa type: J-1
Decision: refusal 221g, reason administrative processing
I have applied for J-1 visa a month ago, and submitted everything that they ask, and what it is needed.
I have history of a J-1 visa and a B-1 approved visa already, so I was quite sure that I can’t be refused.
Plus I am studying in Eu having European PR.
So my mind is basically clueless why does it happened? The interviewer ask basic questions and give me the white paper along with my passport, marking the reason mentioned above.
When I asked him what to do, he explained that I am going to receive an email in couple of days, and I have to respond carefully.
After that, they will tell me the next steps if it is needed(approved).
I have some confusion, as I am panicking now, I have already did so much in my host university the paper work and everything and the project with the american university is decided and they are waiting for me to join from April.
If anyone has an idea what they will ask in the email? And how long it takes to receive of everything goes right?
MY previous experiences takes one week after interview to receive the passport, but this is unexpected for me so I will appereciate the response from the people who have the same experiences.
Thank you all!

VO: have you applied in any other universities

VO: accepted or rejected
Me: I got accepted by both but I haven't paid the admission fee because MIU was my first priority and I got admission there. I would pay fee for next university incase if I was not able to make it to MIU. …

These questions are so simple but in a way its more difficult for those students who are feeling hesitation in front of visa officer.
So the thing all students have to do is Just be confident and look in the eyes of the visa officer. Don’t lie about anything, they already have your background data and talk to them what they ask in simple words. 
Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

Hi All,
I've recently accepted a Job offer in Boston and will be moving there by end of July/ Early August from Pakistan. My visa has also been approved.

Salam Guys, today was my F1-Student Visa interview at Islamabad embassy and I got the visa, Alhamdulila. I am writing this post to share my experience and the whole interview process. This group is very helpful and I am grateful for all your help. 
Profile:
-First Attempt with no travel history
-Applied for MS Computer Science
-Had Assistantship from the university (shown in I-20 financial section as well)
-IELTS 7.5
-GRE 303
-BS cGPA 2.90/4
-I had bank statement of approximately 31,000 USD. I was only required to show ~13,000 USD as I had assistantship. My university corresponding person told me that its better to show total required amount even if you have assistantship/aid (though it was not required).
I did all by myself and no consultant was involved. I took a bundle of documents with me, though they checked only my I-20 and Bank statement but I will suggest you to bring as much documents of proof as you can (like property documents, earning proofs, degrees etc). I was the first one to be interviewed in the Non-Immigrant section even though my appointment was at 8am (there were 7am people too but I was first in the queue). The whole interview took approximately 2 minutes and then he gave me Blue paper (picture attached). I have heard that Green paper is for visa approval and blue paper is for visa approval and urgent passport delivery (my sister got blue paper and received her passport after 3 hours from embassy). 
Following are my Interview Questions+Answers:
1. Hello Sir, what is your purpose to visit USA?
Ans: I am going for my Master's degree.
2. Why you choose this school?
Ans: Because I am getting the scholarship here and also this university has one of the best CyberSecurity department.
3. What do you intend to do with this degree?
Ans: I am planning to start my own software company here in Pakistan. I think with my previous job experience and this degree, I will be sufficiently capable to handle a company.
4. Show me your bank statement. Who is your sponsor?
Ans: My father is my sponsor. (provided my bank statement, statement was of my own bank account even though my father was sponsor, he just looked at it for like 5 seconds).
5. What does your father do?
Ans: He is a government officer.
Then he said ""Gentleman, your visa is approved, you will get your passport in few days"" and handed me blue slip.

My visa interview experience.
Visa type: F1
Program: PhD in Chemistry (Fully funded)
University: Boston University
Status: Approved
June 
10, 2022 ,
US embassy, Islamabad
Travel History: 
US, as an exchange student
China, as a summer school student
 I wanted to share my interview experience for all those who are nervous about the interview, especially by seeing so many posts about visa rejection. Everyone's case is different.  Just be confident and sincere. 
So my interview was scheduled at 11 in the morning.  I reached at the shuttle service by 10 am. (On google map, it's, ""Visa Seeker Shuttle Service, for those who are not from Islamabad). 
 Went through the security and got the shuttle pass for Rs 2000. After about 5 minutes the shuttle came and took us to the embassy. Documents verification at the window (there were long lines and the process took about 15-20 minutes).
Then outside the interview hall, there were gain a long queue and entered the interview hall by 11:20, FINALLY!!!
Again documents verification, fingers scanning, and then you wait for your turn. Another 15-20 minutes. 
After the interview shuttle takes you back to the Shuttle Service area. There you can find taxis (if you need one) but they'll charge you almost double. So, if you want to save some money 
  public transport (vans) also pass by the area. 
VO: Hi, welcome. Pass me your documents.
Me: Hi. Passed her my documents.
VO: Put your left hand fingers on the scanner.
While I was scanning my fingers, 
VO: So you already have been to the US?
Me: Yes. I was there as an exchange student.
(She already started typing something)
VO:As an undergrad student?
Me: Yes.
VO: How long did you stay there?
Me: for one semester, that was about 5 months.
VO: Was it fully funded? 
Me: Yes. It was. Funded by the state department.
VO: Great. So this is a Fully-funded program right? (Looking at my I-20)
Me: Yes. It is. ( I wanted to mention that the university is also paying for the air tickets and the health insurance etc. But  she informally asked smiling (while typing) i'm just curious where were you placed when you last time in the uS?
Me: Told the University name.
She then asked about my experience, and did i like the place, people etc.that was kinda informal chat, i felt.
VO: Okay, so you'll be doing PhD in Chemistry, what type of Chemistry?
Me: I'll be working on  the development of plasmonic nanoparticles for water treatment.
VO: ok, water treatment? Great.
She typed another few secs and said, congratulations your visa is approved.
Me: thank you. 
Then I requested her for temperory withdrawal of my passport as I needed for another visa interview ( at German embassy)
She held my visa on pending till I return my passport.
The interview hardly lasted for 1 minute.
The waiting process was exhausting but worth it.
Best of luck

“SO HERE IF MY F1 VISA INTERVIEW JOURNEY”
            NO CONSULTANT INVOLVED 
                   *FIRST INTERVIEW*
Karachi Consulate 
My first was on 24 November 2021. 
Refused under 214B. 
University of Texas at Arlington.

My Profile was completely same. Not a single thing was changed. 
VO: Hello. How are you doing?
Me: Great. How about you?
VO: What changes you have made since your last application?
Me: Nothing. Because I want to go for this university!!
VO: Why you were rejected?
Me: I was nervous and didnt satisfy the officer. 
VO: Okay. So how you choose this university?
Me: Through US News. 
VO: Oh come on. US News has thousands of university. How you find this university?
Me: i searched HRM in search option. Found universities and saw this. 
VO: You are not getting my point. tell me how you filter this university. 
Me: I choose this university through course curriculum and I have talked to students as well. 
VO: so you have talked to the students as well. How and where?
Me: On LinkedIn and facebook group. 
VO: So what you have talked about?
Me: They told me the best thing about this university is that you can reach to professor directly rather than his assistants. 
VO: So my question is how you choose this university from thousands of university. If i write hrm in search of US News. Will it arrive among the thousand of university on Top?
ME: Yes it will arrive and this university more focued on analytical side rather theoretical which i was looking for. 
VO: So US News have filters options for cities and states as well? ( she laughed) 
Me: Yes. (I laughed back)
Vo: Are you sure?

4 January 2022. 

My Profile was completely same. Not a single thing was changed. 

VO: Hello. How are you doing?
Me: Great. How about you?

VO: What changes you have made since your last application?
Me: Nothing. Because I want to go for this university!!

VO: Why you were rejected?
Me: I was nervous and didnt satisfy the officer. 

VO: Okay. So how you choose this university?
Me: Through US News. 

VO: Oh come on. US News has thousands of university. How you find this university?
Me: i searched HRM in search option. Found universities and saw this. 

VO: You are not getting my point. tell me how you filter this university. 
Me: I choose this university through course curriculum and I have talked to students as well. 

VO: so you have talked to the students as well. How and where?
Me: On LinkedIn and facebook group. 

VO: So what you have talked about?
Me: They told me the best thing about this university is that you can reach to professor directly rather than his assistants. 

VO: So my question is how you choose this university from thousands of university. If i write hrm in search of US News. Will it arrive among the thousand of university on Top?
ME: Yes it will arrive and this university more focued on analytical side rather theoretical which i was looking for. 

VO: So US News have filters options for cities and states as well? ( she laughed) 
Me: Yes. (I laughed back)

Vo: Are you sure?
Me: Yes 100%

VO: Should I check it Right Now?
ME: Yes please. 

Vo:  “laughed” Let it be. 
Vo: So you will be doing MBA or Ms?
Me: I will be doing masters of science in human resource management. 

Vo: Why not Mba?
Me: Because mba is more focused toward theoretical side and Ms is more towards analytical side and I was looking for more technical learning. 

Vo: theory and analytics are all same. 
Me: No, you are wrong. Theoretical is more focused towards laws and you know…… (i forget) continued. Analytical is more focused towards tools and techniques. I will be learning tools like R, Python,HRIS. 

Vo: how many universities you have applied and name?
Me: 4 universities. University of texas at arlington. University of north texas. Dallas baptist and websters which is in Missouri. 

VO: Why you only focused on Texas?
ME: because texas is one if the most emerging state and it has similer climate as well which is in karachi. 

VO: Do you know the temperature Dallas had last night?
ME: Yes -2. 

VO: so how it is same as in Karachi?
Me: Yes it is somehow different and i want to experience that as well. Also texas and sindh both are deserted area hence same climate. 

VO: She laughed loud. 

VO: okay so who will pay this fees?
Me: my uncle?
