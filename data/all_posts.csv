Interview: 16th June 2022
Interviewer: A lady
PhD Civil Engineering, University of Kansas.
Morning Mam,
VO: 
Morning
Questions:
What's University name in US? 
KU
What's your Major? 
Civil Engineering
Why were you in China? 
Study
Was that on scholarship? 
Yes
Had a same major in China?
Yes
Which University in China? 
Told
What's your proposed research in US? 
Told
So you have an assistantship, who's is your supervisor? 
I told her the name of my supervisor, she searched the internet and she asked me to spell it because she couldn't find it.  Then I passed her the CV of my supervisor and when she saw his profile, she searched on the internet again.  After typing a few seconds, she told me that, ""I'm approving your visa."" Congratulations.
#Tips
: Be confident and answer to the point, no need to explain. 
#Experience
: If you are having travel history and an assistantship then the interview is just a formality.
#Feeling
: I was feeling excited but once the shuttle bus driver and some other workers saw the ""approval slip"" in my hand they asked for ""Methai"".  I ignored them once but they kept asking for methai which was very annoying.  They have no ethics.  I spent 4 years in China and this was my second day in Pakistan after 4 years.  I saw many beggars on Islamabad road's and even in the embassy office today.

US J1 and J2 visa approved. ( long post)
Date: 27th Feb 2023. 
I went with my husband and two year old baby. Our interview was scheduled for 8:00 PM at Islamabad Embassy. We were there on time. 
After scanning fingerprints and other formalities we were sent to a counter that had a fat young American lady sitting with a polite expression on her face. The lady looked extremely professional.
Me: Good Morning
VO: 
good morning, pls pass me your documents.
Ok so I understand you are going for study.
Me: yes I am going for Exchange visitor research based trip to Uni of Michigan Ann Arbor. Its a six month scholarship fully funded by HEC and after completing it I'll be back and complete my PhD here. At Uni of Michigan I plan to have intensive research under the supervision of the my foreign supervisor who is also the chair of dpt of English language and literature Uni of Michigan
( all this time she was typing and looking on the screen but looked satisfied with my answer)
VO: ok so what is your research about?
Me: I am doing my PhD with majors in English Literature and subfield is Cultural memory and trauma studies with focus on politics of history in conflict zones. 
VO: wow interesting! Pls tell me more about Cultural memory studies, its new to me( she was smiling)
Me: Here I spoke for one minute on my research topic and the terms she was imtersted to know about.
VO: so what material you use for your research?
Me: well in arts and humanities we conduct corpus based research by which i mean we pick Anglophonic writings so I am working on indigenous writing from the Conflict zone of Kashmir. (She looked impressed)
VO: ok, I understand its a fully funded trip?
Me: Yes I bagged HEC IRSIP scholarship which is fully funded. 
VO: oh HEC the one which has headoffice here in Islamabad?
Me: I smiled, yes you got it right VO.
VO: are you both cousins?
Me: No.. just distant relatives.
VO: to my husband...ok I understand you have a brother in US who is US citizen.
( we mentioned this in our DS19)
Husband: yes certainly, my brother is living in New Jersy and doing a job there but I understand we are going to Michigan-a different state.
Vo: what's your profession.
Husband: I am banker by profession( he explained in little detail)
VO: do you guys have plans of settling in the US?
We both replied No at once. I added that we are satisfied with our jobs here so no plans.
VO: For how many years are you both married?
Me: told the exact time period and year. 
Vo: pls pass me your FRC.
Me: passed the the family and baby related documents. 
VO smiled and gave us a page that had rules of staying in the US. Took my DS and excused us for a while. After one minute she was back . 
Now my baby starting crying so she waved him Hi with a big smile. 
She got up from her chair, signed the DS and handed us over the blue slip with a nice smile. She added that we need to show this DS at immigration. 
We both smiled and thanked her and left the counter. 
Lessons:
When VO asks something speak out the details. Practice and research your answers. Stand straight and upright and constantly maintain eyecontact with VO. They read your facial expressions. So when you say No mean it and when you say Yes mean it. Prepare and practice. They make decision by having a thorough understanding of you. Have all your documents. Basically you need to impress them so that they show interest in you and grant you on the spot visa.
Good luck to all.

Date: 14th October 
Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

3). Or I should ask them to defer my semester from Spring to Fall 2023???

US VISA INTERVIEW
Hey guys, I recently appeared for the F1 visa interview and my visa got approved so I wanted to help you all. Here's a list of all the questions I prepared. The bold ones are the most important questions according to me.
https://docs.google.com/.../10EbWhCd0q2MkVwj8QC86.../edit...
Note: It was my first attempt and I applied for bachelors. A lot of questions might overlap for masters/Ph.D. students but be prepared to answer other questions related to work, research, etc.
TIPS:
1- Be prepared
If you thoroughly prepare for all the questions, you won't get stuck. It doesn't matter if you are not fluent in English or have other issues.  Give your best shot!
2- Be specific
Try to answer in a personalized way. Do not repeat general answers that the visa officers have heard thousands of times. You have to research the university website and google to create specific answers which are unique to you. Stand out from the crowd.
- Be confident
The visa officers are just employees who are doing their work and getting paid. Do not get preconceived notions about which visa officer is good or bad. I have read several times on this group that the visa officer was in a bad mood that's why they rejected me. This is simply not true, they have to write a specific reason when they reject an applicant. 
That's it. Remember me in your prayers.

22,"
Is there anyone who got a rejection after Administrative Processing (221g)? Will they notify by email that your visa is rejected?
I have given interview in Karachi Consulate on April 28, 2022 and since then status was ""Refused"" and the date stated of last update was April 28, 2022 but today I checked again and it still says ""Refused"" but date of last updated changed to July 14, 2022. I got no email.
So I am confused that my visa is still under administrative processing or is it refused.

By any chance does Visa Officer know how much Universities did I applied to?
Cause I have applied at only one and have been accepted there, but I'm worried that applying to only one university may give VO the wrong impression.
So when he asks, How much Universities did you applied to?

Thanks

Hi everyone, need your valuable suggestions.
I applied for MSCS to USA back in July 2022 and got refused in 2 attempts, unfortunately. Now I'm planning for Australia for same degree but consultants are advising me that it'll be very weak case and another rejection is expected with high chances. 
Please add your valuable suggestions to make me a strong decision. 
JazakAllah Khair.

Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Today was my interview for F1 visa and I got rejected in Karachi Consulate.
Visa officer was a chinese young man.
The Visa officer asked me only two questions.
Why do you want to go to the US?
I answered him that , I want to go to the US to pursue my Master's in MPA in university of Albama.
Then 
he interrupted and asked me second question.
Why did you choose this uni specifically?
Firstly, I told him that I got accepted in three uni and I also mentioned the name.
Then I told him about practical courses which the uni has offered me.
Then he passed a white slip and said Sorry I cannot grant you visa, try next time.
He did not ask me anything , not about my sponsor,not about my future goals,my siblings, our business.
I have admiited to the university of Albama for Master's in public administration.
I have also took Duolingo English test and I got 120 marks.
I did my Bachelor's from GCU lahore in political science. After that I had been teaching in the college for the past 3 years.
So plz guide me what to do to get a visa ?

Me: ME in Industrial Engineering. 
VO: Why did you go for Industrial Engineering?
Me: My family has a 4 acre Industrial plot in Pakistan and we have been planning to start a completely new industry here. Hence, the reason I did my Bachelors in Industrial, got a 2 year experience from a Japanese Industry 'Atlas Honda' and now to make my foundation a bit more rigid, need to complete my Masters as well.

My advise for everyone, just be confident and be an active speaker. If they ask you a question, dont just answer them in a single word but start talking like ur having a normal conversation. They literally listen to your jargon even if it makes no sense lol. My sister lives in USA, but they didnt even ask me about her neither they asked for any other documents. 
Ek din pehle kisi dawat mai chale jaana taake uncles aise personal sawal tumse puche so that u know exactly what to answer. Thats exactly what i did lmao. 
Best of luck everyone.

Posting on behalf of my cousin.
Visa status : Refused on 4th August from ISb.
Vo( famous long beard guy) : Pass me your 1-20 and passport.
Me: 
Sure sir .Here you are .
VO:(Looking at I-20)  Scan your left hand fingers.
Me: Did the same .
VO: Why you go to the US ?
Me: To pursue my PhD in Structural Engineering.
VO: Which state ? VO got interrupted to ask about how I got fully funded scholarship...
Me: California.
VO: So it's Caltech ( excellent).Mm fully funded .How many universities did you apply ?
Me: 3, UC Berkeley , Caltech and UT Austin.
VO: Ahn ,did you get admit from them ?
Me: UC Berkeley No ( because I was looking for fully funded offer ) ,UT Austin Yes with fully funded offer.
VO: Why Caltech ?
Me: There is number of reasons behind it 1) Pre-communication with my PhD supervisor, 2) Lab facilities in Caltech are advanced; 3) First university which are offering courses in 3D printing.
VO: why you look for 3D printing courses ?
Me: Because I'll be conducting my research with my supervisor on 3D print Concrete structures.
VO: Perfect. What's 3DPC ? 
Me: It's a digital construction through an automated operation of robot.
VO:Really ? Do you have any publications in this field ?
Me: Yes , 2 journal articles one in Cement and Concrete research and 2nd one is in Automation in construction.
VO: Can I see full list of your research track record? 
Me : Sure sir ,you can have a look on the list that I've mentioned in my resume .
VO: Oh sorry , I didn't notice it.Amazing ,How did you  manage  to do such high quality research in your home country? 
Me: Only few of them , rest of the research specially in 3DPC are from Singapore ( NUS) .
VO: Excellent, NUS has excellent research facilities.What will be your future plans after getting PhD from Caltech ?
Me: Kind of , well sir actually I don't see any scope of 3DPC in my home country in next 20-25 years ,as this is highly advanced and emerging construction technology ,we still rely on traditional formwork construction, therefore , honestly speaking I'll be looking for a job in US or in Australia after having my PhD from Caltech in 3DPC .And...( VO asked ) .
VO: I see, this has to be an emerging and advance technology.You motivated me to study about it.chuckle..He called another guy on his back side and started discussing something while looking at my CV and I-20 .They were taking time ....
VO:Any travel history?
Me: Yes , Singapore, Japan , Turkey, UAE, Thailand and Malaysia etc.
VO: Looking at my old passport and verifying the informations and  said sorry we both have decided not to offer you a visa at this stage ( Gave me white slip) .
Me: shocked ! Any Reason sir. 
VO:a white slip .
Me: should I change my university for the 2nd attempt.
VO: it's not necessary, Caltech is best.
I was wondering and tried to get more Infos from there but couldn't succeed .
I still have the feelings that ties with country in this shouldn't be the case of visa  rejection.
 In addition,the VO didn't ask about GRE, siblings, sponsorship etc .

Hello 
My F2-visa interview was on the 21st of Dec and VO put my case in Administrative Procese (221g) and asked me to provide some documents but I didn't received any email. VO gave me a form and asked me to submit through QR/link and I have submitted documents but didn't get any update from the embassy yet. 
What should I do and what’s the expected waiting time for F2 visa ?
Suggestions please
Thankyou

Me: ok thank you.
THE TRICK IS to be Confident and natural like these questions don’t even matter and don’t get stuck while speaking. Try to stay to the point and not give a comeplete story for every answer you give.
My Experience: I came alone to a place near the embassy to stay. At 1 am I realized My mother hadn’t signed my I-20 I forgot to tell her to sign it.
My friend photostated my I-20 from the call center I worked at and delivered it to my home. 
At 2 am my parents left from Peshawar to give me the signed form. Then they asked to drop me off even tho it was just 5:30, I agreed and found out The roads were blocked and we had to take a long route.
I found out no InDriver no careem no Uber were available at the time. So it was a miracle my family came to drop me off. 
If I hadn’t forgotten to sign my form, my family wouldn’t have had come to drop me off and there’s a chance I would have messed things up 
But Thanks to Allah almighty things worked out.
Moral of the story if it’s written for you it will happen if it’s not Allah has better plans for you. Try try again
Best of Luck everyone May Allah bless us All

Attention Please,
Hello Everyone,
I want to share my two visa interview experiences and want your suggestions on what I did wrong and what I should do now.
1st attempt: November 10, 2022
Karachi Embassy,
1- Why are you visiting the United States?
Ans—to pursue a double major in economics and mathematics for my undergraduate degree at the University of South Dakota (raising his eyebrows after hearing economics and mathematics)
2- What are your future plans?
Ans— After finishing my degree in the United States, I plan to apply for CSS in Pakistan.
3- Where did you get to know about this university?
Ans—the university representatives visited my college at the university fair.
4- How will you fund your studies?
Ans— I got a partial scholarship of $4200, and the rest would be sponsored by my father, muhammad __
5- What does your father do?
A— he is a businessman, he has a business of Road freight logistics services business and a computer retail business.
I was rejected because I made an error while filling out my DS-160, as in my i20 it's business administration and management major, whereas in my DS-160 I filled out Economics with Mathematics. After noticing this mistake, I decided to reapply with a corrected DS-160.
2nd attempt: December 6, 2022
Karachi Embassy,
VO:-What are you going to study?
Me: to pursue a double major in economics and business administration for my undergraduate degree.
VO: Why the University of South Dakota?
Me: There are mainly two reasons: first, my majors are well organized and dedicated, like business administration major also focuses on data analysis, which attracts me. Second, I talked to a student there named Prah Haider, who is a representative of Pakistan, so I always got a positive response regarding campus activities, supportive administration, and the Pakistan community.
VO:- How many universities did you apply to?
Me: I applied to ten universities and was accepted by seven of them, seven of which I named.
VO: Did you apply to Pakistani universities?
""Yes, I applied to IBA, but I want to take advantage of the opportunity to study in the United States.""
VO:-What's changed from your previous rejection?
ME: Yes, I mentioned the wrong major in the DS-160 in my last interview. So here I am with the right one.
VO:- What did you fill in on the previous DS-160?
Me: I only mentioned economics with mathematics by thinking that economics is a business major, and I didn't mention the business major.
Then rejected on 214 b again.
Now I'm at a loss for what to do; I considered deferring my intake for fall 2023, but any advice on how to improve my chances of getting approval a third time would be greatly appreciated.

Status refused 6th March
My interview lasted for 10 minutes atleast everything was going in order. I dont know what is the reason of my  refusal. Experts please tell me what should i do now.
Me. Good morning
Vo. No reply. Give me your i20 and passport
Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world. Degree obtained from usa has much more worth then any of other countries here in pakistan. They also offer practicle courses, flexible education and cultural diversity further enhanced the educational experience. 
Vo. what are you going to study
Me. I going to peruse masters of cyber security.
vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.
Vo. Sory, we can not approve your visa this time and gave me slip.
Experts please tell me where did I go wrong.
"
59,"
Time and time again we see lot of posts on 
#VisaRefused
. And yet all of them have same mistakes. 
Issues with sponsor, lack of enthusiasm for program of study, lack of preparation, and a very strange one; judging the visa officer based on their looks or ethnicity. 
Please keep this in mind, whether visa officer was an american woman, or a Pakistani guy, your refusal has nothing to do with them. They are professional people and authorized to refuse anyone if they doubt the 
intentions. Instead of judging them and setting expectations before the interview, think of not giving them any reasons. 
Keep three things in mind; Be prepared, Be knowledgeable, and Be confident. If you are well prepared for your answers, did your homework, have chosen the right university and sponsor, you don’t have a reason to be nervous. 
But here’s the problem. Most of you don’t know why you want to study, why you chose a certain program and university and furthermore why you only want to study in the US. When you don’t know any of this, you are bound to make mistakes. 
2nd thing, why you guys don’t know the rules and laws of country where you plan to go? Why you are not aware that you can’t apply on immigrant and non immigrant visa at the samw time? Why you are not aware that you can’t get sponsorship from a relative already living in US, that too not your parents. Anyone other than parents as a sponsor is red flag, anyone sponsoring you from the US is red flag 
 
All of these mistakes make things difficult for genuine students too. When every other student appearing for interview have a clear intention to settle in the other country and no interest in studies, why should they give permission to enter their country??
Please please do some homework and ask yourself why are you constantly repeating the same mistakes.
P.S. don’t inbox me please. You are killing the point of this post. I am not here to take a look at everyone’s personal case.

VO: Pass me your passport and I-20
Me: Sure Sir
VO: Put your right hand 4 finger on the scanner
Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Status: Approved, received passport in three days.
Date: April 13, 2022
Consulate/Embassy: Islamabad.
Major and University: Bachelor’s in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts Amherst.
My interview was scheduled for 11 AM, but I got to the Embassy at around 8 AM and the guards allowed me to enter early. I was out of the embassy by 9:15-ish. The interview itself only lasted 3 minutes.
I was asked the following questions:
1: What’s your major.
2: Why did you choose this university.
3: How many did you apply to.
4: Show me your scholarship letter.
5: What does your father do.
6: How much land does your father own.
7: Has he ever travelled outside Pakistan.
8: Have you travelled outside Pakistan in the last five years.
9: What do you intend to do after the degree.
The only thing the VO saw was my admissions letter with scholarship (14,000 USD per year, and funding from my father is 45,000 USD).
There are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about the Visa process here.
If you can:
1: Establish yourself as a genuine student;
2: Show concrete proof of funding;
3: Convince the VO you will return to Pakistan,
You will NEVER be denied the Visa.
1: Establishing yourself as a genuine student:
One of the best — or maybe the only way — to convince the VO that you’re a genuine student is to apply and get accepted to top public or private universities. I applied to 16 public colleges (all top 100 for my major) and I was accepted to 13, Alhumdulillah. There is no such thing as a “visa ratio”; as long as your university is highly ranked for your major, and is selective, you’ll get the visa.
My advice: Please do not hire consultants to apply to universities on your behalf. They only have very low ranking universities that will negatively impact your chances of getting a Visa.
2: Proof of funding:
It’s very important to convince the VO that you/your sponsor can fund at least a full year of living and tuition in the States. My VO did not even ask to see my bank statements, and that was probably because I told her what my father did, and that I had received more scholarships from other universities but ultimately chose UMass because it had a better ranked program — UMass did not offer me the highest scholarship from my list. This convinced the VO that my father can, indeed, fund my stay in the States.
3: Strong ties to home country:
Convince the VO that your entire family is in Pakistan and — if your father owns a business — tell them that you’ll inherit the business. This is usually ample proof.
Also, English speaking skills and confidence go a LONG way. I believe my interview was so short because I was speaking English very naturally and confidently. Which may be why the VO did not even ask for more documents.
I understand that a lot of applicants may not be able to speak English fluently, and I would strongly advise them to invest in English speaking classes at least three months before the interview. If you’re not going for a language program, it’s imperative to have a strong grip on English.

Interview Starts: (It was a very long interview)
Me: Good Morning, Officer!
VO: Hi! Please scan your fingers and then she asked me to pass her the I-20 and passport.

VO: Why did you choose this concentration specifically?
Me: Officer It aligns with my interests and I will be studying courses such as….. VO interrupts
VO: What made you choose this concentration specifically?
Me: Previously, I have done my bachelors thesis in Construction management, and I did great in this area and that developed an interest in me for choosing this concentration.
VO: What was your thesis about?
Me: My thesis title was XYZ and I used Qualitative and Quantitative methods for the findings. I explained her my findings too.
VO: Pass me your CV ( Note: I also had the research paper of that thesis but she didn’t ask me for that)
VO: So is your program thesis-based?
Me: Yes officer, it is thesis based as It is Master of science so we have to do the thesis work.
Vo: So in which Topic you gonna do the thesis?
Me: Officer I have interest in BIM, Rivet and other application software so definitely I’m gonna look into that.
VO: In which Unis did you applied to?
Me: I applied to 5 universities and I got admit from 4 of them; University of Dayton, University of Texas at Arlington, Thomas Jefferson University and University of Kansas but I was rejected by Florida State University.
VO: Why this University?
Me: I choose this university because of the top-notch faculty at University of Dayton. I recently talked to Dr. XYZ, who is the professor at UD and he told me that he has been working on projects related to BIM, Rivet and other application software which are the emerging Technology here in Pakistan so I would love to take part in these projects if I get a chance.
VO: Why only USA?
Me: As being a civil engineer, we follow american building standards in our designing phase and while testing materials… VO interrupts 
VO: Why not UK or any other country?
Me: UK doesnot follow american building codes which I have learned previously so they won’t me useful for me once I get back to Pakistan.
VO: Then why are you not completing your masters in Pakistan?
Me: Because Pakistan does not use advance technology in their research system as USA has done a wider range of research contribution in the field of civil engineering and construction management. That why I believe US is the ideal place for me to pursue my higher education.
VO: Are you currently working?
Me: Yes, I’m working as a Trainee Engineer at XYZ Company.
VO: What is your work there?
Me: Officer, my job responsibilities include inspection of roads, ensuring the progress of the project to supervisor and so on….
VO: Who will be sponsoring you?
Me: My father will be sponsoring me.
VO: What does he do?
Me: I told her my father’s occupation and his annual income in total.
She kept on typing……
Vo: Are you sure this much income?
Me: Yes officer. (I was confident because I had all the financial docs but she never asked for that)
VO: Which department is your father in like under which ministry does it comes in?
Me: Told her that.
VO: Have you ever visited to USA before?
Me: No, I haven’t yet.
VO: Do you have any siblings?
Me: Yes, I have two elder siblings. (Told her about their jobs).
She kept on typing…..
Vo: So do they live with you or lives separately?
Me: We all live together.
VO: How long will be your stay in US?
Me: It will be 2 years long officer.
VO: So, what is your dream job?
Me: Once I will complete my masters, I will return to Pakistan and I will rejoin the same firm…. VO interrupts
VO: So, it’s your dream job to rejoin your same company? (Sarcastically smiles)
Me: No officer, My long-term plan and my dream is to establish my open construction firm in Pakistan as the construction Industry is already booming here.
(During this answer, she kept the yellow slip in here hands and for a sec, I thought it’s a rejection because of that colour)
VO: Congratulations, I’m approving your visa. Do collect your passport in..
 (After hearing the approval, I don’t remember what exactly she said lol)
Me: Thank you so much officer, Have a great day!
Note: None of my answer was ONE-WORD and all the answers were relevant to my program. You must make a story in your head which shows you’re academically well enough and your answers should be mentioning your home ties with your country. (DONOT COPY OTHER’S GENERIC ANSWERS)
The thing that helped me was my Trust in Allah, which is very important. Secondly, I worked day and night for 5 months and I did my own research throughout the process. My GPA was below average but I still managed to get the admissions and visa.
There are a bunch of guys who helped me in my admission and interview phase, and I want to thank

VO: Good Morning.
ME: Good Morning (with a smile)
VO: Which program are you going for?
ME: I am going for M. in HealthCare Analytics from RMU. 
VO: I see you were previously refused twice, why did you change your university and course?
ME: After my previous refusal I had plenty of time to search for a better option. I applied at RMU and pivoted my area of study as I believe Analytics has greater demand here in Pakistan. My own company recently moved from its old database to an advance one, and company had to hire 3rd party employees to train us. I realized I need to upgrade my skills in Analytics and Computing to advance my career. 
VO: Where do you work?

ME:  (Explained his business)
VO: (asked some details about his business) 
ME: Answered along with his annual turnover. 
VO: ( with a little giggle) Don’t your father wants you to takeover his business? 
ME: ( with a cheesy smile) No, because I already have my foot in the carrer in Pharma, I have a Doctor of Pharmacy degree. ( Mentioned my degree because father’s business has nothing common with it). 
VO: (After a short pause) how many sibling do you have? 
ME: I have a younger sister who works at the Aga Khan University Hospital as a xyz. 
VO: So, your previous qualification is of masters? (Looks intensely at the screen)
ME: No, its of Doctor, its a five year degree program. 
VO: Oh! ( paused and started typing at the screen for a minute).
Then came the Golden words “Your Visa is APPROVED, collect your passport bla bla bla” 
ME: ( Still in Poker face) Thank you, Have a nice day. 
VO: you too.

I want to renew the passport for 10 years so that i won't have any problems right after the completion of my degree and during Opt time. Can i ask for a visa renewal at this time since it hasn't expired yet? Plss guide me with this.

I’ve been refused twice for F-1 visa. I don’t know what VO is looking for. Please guide the following:
-> Should I change my university this time?
My university in previous attempts was SIUE (with 8K/year) scholarship. I’ve been accepted in Purdue Northwest (without scholarship) too, should I go with SIUE  or change it to Purdue?
-> 
My uncle were my sponsor in previous attempts. Now my principal sponsor is my father. (Circumstances changed)
Please guide what should I do as I’m a genuine student with a good profile but still they are refusing me. Should I only go with changed sponsor or should I change university too?
Profile:
BS ECE (3.43/4.00)

I am writing this post not to share my visa interview but to share something we all need to look upon. Me along with 6 of my peers/friends did not only get into us universities but we got in with  scholarships and had no issues with visa at all. Why am I trying to convey this? Because we started with the rigut process, that made us actual students and not just people entering us to settle. We all started with deciding good top tier universities including columbia, NYU, U 
miami, UCL etc. Not only we did extensive research on universities but we knew what program we wanted to and did work as actual students. We did not consult any consultants before applying or even cared about the visa at that time. We just wanted an acceptance with a scholarship and visa was the second part. I just want to say is do your research, apply for universities, make an effort of getting into top universities, see it as an opportunity to learn and not to settle there and everything will fall in place. They will grant you visa if you only satisfy their 3 conditions, which are if you are a genuine student, your funds and your family ties. Scholarship and acceptance in good universities cleared the pathway for all 6 of us and everyone of us got visa under 30 seconds. Don't try to fool the system because the system and people managing the system are 100 time smarter than you think!

Need suggestions from seniors and experienced students/individuals
Assalam o Alikum Guys, 
What is the best time to book my F1 visa interview for Fall 2023 semester. I am planning to reappear in visa interview in March or April 2023 but I am bit curious isn't it too early to appear in visa interview for Fall 2023? or should I appear in June or July 2023? 
P.S. 
I got refused twice in December 2022 for F1 (Masters). I have contacted my university and deferred my semester to Fall 2023. I received my updated I-20 for Fall 2023 as well. The Fall 2023 classes will be starting from August 2023.

VISA EXPERIENCE 
VISA APPROVED,ALLHAMDULLILAH
21July'22 9:00am ( hardly 5 mints interview)
Visa officer -chinese looking guy( Karachi embassy)
Vo : good morning 
Me: 
hello good morning Vo
Vo: please put your fingers on scanner, pressed tightly the pinky finger ( in a laughing way)
Me: does as told
Vo: oh I see you are working in a bank?
Me: yes I work in a local bank of Pakistan as Trainer / quality assurance executive in customer satisfaction and quality department. I train freshly hired officer (said a bit proudly:p)
Vo: why are you going to USA?
Me: i am going to USA for pursuing my MBA in marketing from New Mexico Highland University,  lasvegas 
Vo: How did you get to know about this university?
Me: my previous university professor recommended me this uni as he was an alumni of nmhu. Beside this I searched this university through different website like us news, niche and master portal.
Vo: you have such a stable job, why you want to leave it ?
Me: after becoming Trainer I didn't thought to go for masters degree because I was already achieving my goals step by step. But recently I got rejected for a managerial post in my company with a reason that I am not holding a masters degree and( as this was eligibility criteria for managerial post) this thing hit me harder and then I decided to apply for Mba. ( tbh it's a true story)
Vo: oh i see, after looking at my I 20 meticulously he said, oh who is xyz( my sponsor's name)
Me: he is my uncle who live in USA and is a US citizen 
Vo: what he do for living?
Me: He owns an It company named as xyz. This company is in over 240+ location but he owns the Santonio location.
Vo: will you ask you employer for leaves or you will resign ?
Me: I have discussed this with my head of department, they are talking with HR let's see what they will suggest. You know every firm has it on policy. Even if the don't approve my sabbatical leaves I'll resign and rejoin after completing my MBA. I know I  will get the job with my acquaintance and credibility 
Vo: congratulations you VISA is approved. 
*Posting this for encouraging all those people who are scared of several things. My case my pretty critical, chances of rejection was high because of primarily two reasons:
1. My brother lives in USA currently he recently got graduated from Louisiana state university and is in opt right now( vo didn't even asked about him)
2. Secondly my sponsor was my mother's cousin who is a US citizen.
But that's not a big thing if your are confident and sound genuine, means your story should sound real not made up. The most important thing is your  faith in Allah. If you say that I have strong faith but stillyou feel scared and week then your beliefs are not strong. I would like to thanks 
Rana Ibrar
  who helped me to articulate my answers , encouraged and motivated me for acing this interview. I couldn't achieved this without his help.

VISA INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE 
Please keep this Anonymous!!!!!!
Date 04 Nov, 2022
Time 8:30 Am
Officer was a young female. 
ME: Hello
VO: Can I have you documents?
ME: Sure Sir! 
VO smiled.
ME: SORRY Ma’am. 
VO: Smiled again and said “it’s okay atleast you apologised”
VO: So which university are you going to?
ME: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University or commonly called as Virginia Tech. 
VO: What level of study?
ME: Masters
VO: In which Subject?
ME: In Civil Engineering.
VO: And what will be your Concentration?
ME: Construction Engineering and Management. 
VO: Where did you complete your bachelor from?
ME: UET Peshawar.
VO: Will you be doing any research Project?
ME: Yes hopefully.
VO: And what research will that be?
ME: I’ll do research on BIM and Sustainability. 
VO: Okay I see. So who’ll be paying for you studies. 
ME: My Father. 
VO: So what kind of business man is he?
ME: No Ma’am, he’s not a business man. He is a ________ in ______. 
VO: Sorry what? 
ME: Repeated.
VO: Woah!! So is he like a Doctor?
ME: Yes exactly. 
VO: Why is he working in _______?
ME: Better opportunity I guess.
VO: Okay. I see you have relatives in the US.
ME: Yes ma’am but not any immediate relatives. Just extended family.
VO: Like who?
ME: Cousins and some aunts and uncles. 
VO: Are they in Virginia?
ME: No. 
VO: Okay I am approving your Visa. 
ME: Thank you!
NO other documents asked during the interview. 
I saw a post a day or two ago of someone mentioning their experience of the same date. They said that no one got approved. I just want to say that don’t get distracted by such comments. I was interviewed early and was out of the embassy by 8:30 and before me three people got approved. 
All I can say from my experience that University matters alot and never lie on DS-160. A lot of people on the group say that don’t disclose any relatives in the US. Half of my family is there and are citizens but when asked I told them the truth. 
Don’t let anyone discourage you. Apply to good, high ranked Universities, don’t lie on the DS-160, and always ALWAYS pray to Allah. And In Sha Allah youll get the visa.

Hi, I was refused 214(b) by the infamous Chinese/Asian V.O at Karachi consulate. Today 10-06-2022. I am sharing his questions and my answers, please guide what mistakes have I made. And when can I take another appointment at the earliest. 
Q1. What are you doing presently?
Ans: I am working as a Stack Developer (MERN) Stack application developer, this technology stack is based on JavaScript
The 
company with which I am working has their own products we deploy them as well, you have started here recently what were you doing earlier,? for three months I was working on my own and did projects, worked on my skills. Before that I worked for 3.5 years as an Automation Engineer at a pharmaceutical firm.
Q2. What are you going to study?
Ans: I am going to study, my Masters in Computer Science, in what field specifically in computer science? I replied Mobile Application Development, I want to focus on creation of Apps for Disabled People, having more accessibilty option.
Q3. Tell me about your family?
Ans: My parents and a younger sibling.
I stopped here, and I believe should have said more, he kept on typing and then rejected me.
Please guide me, what should I do to improve, my profile is as follows:
1. BS Electronic Engineer (CGPA: 3.06/4) 2016 Graduate.
2. Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Science 2020-2021.
3. IELTS (7.5/9)
No significant gaps in my education or career. One thing I would note is that the officer was uninterested in conducting the interview and was not interactive in the sense that, common questions were not even asked, Why US, Why this University, Who is sponsoring you. 
I have interacted with other students and this officer has rejected a number of candidates, he was not even reponsive to a Hi/Hello, rather I felt that he just wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. I am really saddened, today worked really hard for this. Please guide me and also when should I reschedule.

F-1 Visa Interview Experience
Karachi Consulate
Date: 30-1-2023
Profile:
Duolingo:125
Community College: Highline College
Major: Computer Science
Visa Status:Rejected
Age:16
Counter no: Don't remember, but I think it was 6
Visa officer appearance: A healthy American officer without glasses in his 30s
Time: 8:45 A.M
The ground for rejection I think is not being confident and not showing enough ties to Pakistan. Another reason I think it is for community college as I am not able to get admission in a university because I am under qualified (11th grade). I know it's stupidity to apply for visa for Community College but I will be saving two precious years of my life.
VO: Why are you going to USA?
Me: I am going to USA to pursue my education in Computer Science at Highline College
VO: Ok, what will you do after your 2 year program?
Me: I will transfer to Washington State University ( he interrupted me here and I wanted to say more that I will come back to Pakistan after completing my studies and my future plans. The reason I think I was under confident and I have stammering problems).
VO: Have you applied to WSU?
Me: No, I haven't ( he interrupted me here also. I wanted to say that I am in the grade 11 and I am under qualified to join the university, but joining to CC will help me to save precious years of my life. The reason why I was unable to say because I am under confident and I have stammering problems)
VO: How will you finance your education?
Me: I was telling my answer and he gave me a slip that you were rejected under 214(b).
It was my first attempt for visa interview, the whole process was smooth till the biometrics and there were not many people for the interview. A girl on another counter which seemed to be very confident got her visa approved and their conversation was very relax. So, I thought I will get my visa if I get a chance to convince the visa officer. But the whole situation changed in a moment and I was not able to face the situation because the interviewer is asking questions in hurry, I lost my confidence and I am only 16 and it was my first time.  I know I am making excuses, I have prepared a lot for my interview but I have stammering problem and the interview was only under 45 seconds.
My education plan is to study at Highline Community College and my major is Computer Science. The reason why I have chosen this community college is because I want to get admission in University of Washington, which is the world class university. Some people will say, complete your education till grade 12 and then apply directly to this university. But let me give you an interesting fact, the admission rate for international students for CS Programme for University of Washington (Direct to major) specifically is 4% only, whereas the transfer rate for CS Programme from this community college is 98% and these are real numbers. Some people will say now, apply visa for a university and then transfer to this community college. But I don't want to put myself in this hassle. The whole process from start to end, from admission to visa documents, was done all by myself and I don't hire any consultant. 
Should I reapply for visa, what you guys suggest?

Suggestions based on personal experience:
1st During visa don't talk about something which trigger Technology Alert List (TAL) (
https://www.vanderbilt.edu/.../visa.../technology-alert/
) 
2nd UN has 17 goals to be achieved by 2030 check here (
https://www.un.org/.../desa/disabilities/envision2030.html
) if anyone some how can relate his/her program with these goals has higher chances to get visa on very 1st interview.

Hello,
I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s graduate program (in NYC), with a financial aid award that covers tuition, Bard-sponsored housing/accommodation, and health insurance. However, expenses related to travel and food will not be waived and I’d be entirely responsible for managing them. Moreover, the program does not have any on-campus jobs/employment (I’m not allowed to live/work off-campus) and I would quite literally be on my own. I wanted to write here 
to ask for advice: Should I say yes to this offer? Is it possible to be a bit too frugal in New York and save money/stop myself from needless spending? Would I be able to manage? How can I bring down the remaining costs that have not been covered by my financial aid award? Any sort of assistance/piece of advice is welcomed.
Thank you very much.

Hello group members!
I want to do undergraduate in CS from MIT. I know it's extremely hard to land at this institution but I have a great academic record and academic achievements however I don't have done any major extra curricular activities. Alumni's of MIT suggest that you should have something in your profile that MIT lacks and you have to show them that you are able to fulfill the required gap in order to get accepted. CS is a very competitive field to get into, so 
please tell me which domain with CS combined should I choose in order to land at MIT? What extra curriculars should I do? And which thing that MIT lacks and what they are looking for in the students nowadays?
Please note that I am looking for some serious advice. So, if you don't have any advice, please don't make your input here.

Hello folks, I have two questions regarding shortlisting and filling applications of universities.
1)  Is applying to just 3 universities enough, rather than applying to 5 or 6 universities? I mean, is a person on safe side if he/she has applied to just 3 universities?
2)  I have received an official email from UT Arlington which says, 
**In addition to admissions documents, you will be required to submit financial and immigration documents in order to process your I-20. 
Although these forms may be submitted after an admission decision is made, early submission is encouraged.**
Does it mean this university has accepted my application or something else?
Dear members, I will be grateful if any seniors can explain this to me as I need really serious information on it.
JazakAllah khair

Bismillah, Alhamdulillah by the grace of Allah and prayers of my parents my visa has been approved.
Visa interview experiences
Here is the detailed post for all of my interview experiences from 2017 to 2021. 
It 
is going to be a long post so please bear the headache in your stomach while reading. However, I will try to make it short. 
So it all started when I completed my intermediate(HSSC) from Pakistan. I did my IELTS and applied through a consultant at Wichita state university. My score in IELTS was not that good also, I secured admission in a pathway program.  
1st interview experience.
Embassy: Islamabad
University: Wichita state university. 
Course: Pathway+ bachelors in Aerospace engineering. 
Date: I don't remember the exact date but I think it was on the 4th of Feb 2017. 
Vo: Good morning
Me: Good morning mam. How are u?
Vo: Give me ur documents
Me: Handed over my documents to her. 
Vo: Why are you going to us?
Me: I am going to pursue my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering.
Vo: Which uni?
Me: Wichita state uni
Vo: Why this uni?
Me: Told about uni curriculum, professor's research, etc.
Vo: How many unis u have applied to?
Me: 3 and named them.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: Father
Vo: What does your sponsor do?
Me: Told about my father's govt job and rental shops that we own.
Vo: Give me your bank statement?
Me: Gave her
Vo: Educational documents as well..
Me: I handed over all the documents to her. 
Vo took my passport i20 along with those documents which were asked ...
Ok, I am giving you this white sheet for processing ur documents..  means 221(g).
My case was transferred into the administration process where they verify documents I think. I was really happy as 90+% 221g cases are approved. When I left the embassy and check the online status, it was saying refused. I was stunned that how it could be possible that after one hour of my interview, they refused me. Anyhow, after a few days, I got an email to pick up your documents from .... location, I picked up my documents along with 214B sheet. It was really unfair to me as everything was genuine and still, they rejected me.. 
I thought to apply again as I wasn't aware of the reason for rejection. 
2nd interview experience.
Embassy: ISL
University: I applied with the same university and with the same course as it was in my first interview.
Date: It was in March 2017
The visa officer just asked 3 questions.
VO: Which uni?
Me: Wichita state university.
 VO: Have you ever visit any country?
Me: No, never.
The Visa officer handed over me 214b and said I cannot approve your visa, I left the embassy without saying anything.
3rd interview experience. 
Embassy: ISL
University: Same uni and course.
Date: March 2017
Vo. Good morning 
Me. Good morning how are you?

Me. 22 
Vo . hmmm 22? 
Me. O sorry it's 21 
Vo. Checked my i20 n said how long is ur pathway?

Vo. Oh 2 semesters with a surprising look
Me. Vo gave me time n I told about my situation after telling vo seemed to be satisfied
Vo. Oh suparco company (as I told him that I will join that company after completing my bachelor's degree from USA. it's a space organization in Pakistan)
Vo. Do u have any relatives there?
Me. No.
Vo. Any friend?
Me. I said yes he is my class fellow.
Vo. Oh, where is he living?
Me. In Wichita.
Vo. Paka in Urdu
Me. Yes
Vo. Typing something on the screen 
Vo. Asked a question but I didn't understand him I was like he was asking about my start day of school
Me. I did a blunder here and was totally confused.
Vo. Looking at me for some seconds like he wants to give me a visa but I am not giving him satisfying answers
Vo. Ok, give me your bank statement.
Me. Gave
Vo. Apky sponser kya krty hain in urdu?
Me. He is doing a job in....
Vo. Another question was in urdu but I can't remember.
After looking at me he gave me yellow slip n me apko abi viisa nai de sakta but ap or counsler se try kr skty hain agr ap mutafik hain..
After getting 3 rejections, I thought to apply to more universities and I got accepted into 5-6 universities this time. I selected Indiana tech university as I was having a good amount of scholarships. 
4th attempt.
Embassy: ISL
University; Indiana institute of technology with $13000 scholarship.
Course: Bs mechanical engineering without any pathway.
Date: August 2017.
Intake: Fall.
VO: which uni? 
Me: Indiana tech.
Vo: Why you are going for engineering again?
Me: I said, I did intermediate here in Pak but not engineering. 
Vo: which program?
Me: bs mechanical eng.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father is sponsoring me along with this I have secured a 13000$ scholarship from that uni,
Vo: what does your father do?
Me: Same answer. 
Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is written in this paper(214B).
After getting a rejection, I thought to apply again for the Spring intake. 
5th attempt.
Embassy: ISL.
University: Same as it was in 4th attempt.
Date: 31 November 2017
Intake: Spring.
Vo: Where are you going?
Me: Fort Wayne biggest city of Indiana state,
Vo: Can I explain the changes in my profile?
Vo: no thanks,
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: Father 
Vo: What does he do?
Me: same as I used to speak for my sponsor in previous interviews.
Vo: I cannot approve your visa. 
Me: Thanks.
It was my fifth attempt and had wasted almost two years for the same. I can apply for Australia or Uk at that time, my brain was saying to apply in other countries and my heart was like no no you should go to the USA as it has been my biggest wish to get a USA visa and study over there. 
Anyways, I decided to complete my bachelor's here in Pakistan and apply again for my master's study in the states. 
I completed my bachelor's degree in October 2020 with a 3.7 CGPA.
I took the Duolingo test(alternate of IELTS due to Covid days) and scored 130. Right after completing my bachelor's, I applied to 4 universities with the help of Asim Sahab(my career counselor) Depaul University, Saint Louis University, Oregon state university, and I got accepted in all of them with partial scholarships for spring intake 2021. 
After getting admits, I thought why not apply to some well-ranked university. I dropped off my plans for Spring intake 2021 and applied to Northeastern University(Ranked under top 50 universities nationally according to US News ranking) by myself with the help of Zaryab(A great friend of mine). I got admit from it for the fall intake 2021.
After getting i20, I applied for an appointment from US embassy ISL. I got an appointment for 13th July. 
6th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 13/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
It took almost 1 hour I believe by going through the routine process from shuttle service to embassy.
I wasn't aware of that bald guy who was famous for rejections. Unfortunately, I had to give my interview to the same VO. He rejected a student before me.
Me: Good morning.
VO: No reply.
Vo: Can you pass me your documents?
Me: Sure.
Vo: Let's take fingerprints first. 
Me: I did the same and asked if it is done?
Vo: Yeah.
Me: Cool.
Vo: Why are you going to the US?
Me: I am going to us to pursue my master's in project management from Northeastern University, Boston. 
Vo: Why did you choose this school?
Me: I asked him to repeat the question as his voice was not clear.
Vo: He repeated the question.
Me: Besides its ranking that comes under the top 50 schools nationally according to US news ranking I choose NEU due to its course curriculum that offers different electives, workshops and a capstone project,  (Vo interrupted me)
Vo: Who is paying for your trip?
Me: Father.
Vo: What does he do?
Me: I was explaining about my father job and business( He interrupted again)
Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is mentioned in this paper(yellow sheet, here he handed me two yellow sheets, I was like o bhai mere pas dher laga huwa yellow sheets ka already 
 )
Me; thanks and left the embassy with a shattered heart as I was really prepared for this attempt and made many changes in my profile this time. Anyhow, I decided to reapply as It seems unfair to me without knowing the reason he rejected me even he was not listening to my answers. 
I did not bother to change anything in my profile as I did not exactly know the reason for rejection. 
7th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 30/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
Before me, one student visa got approved who got rejected previously and the visa officer asked him what changes he made in his profile he said no changes as he was not confident last time and now he is. He got his visa approved. 
after that student officer asked me to move forward.
Me: good morning how are you doing?
Vo: He said good thank you,
Vo: I see you have been refused already so what changes do you bring out this time?
Me: I don’t feel to make any changes in my profile since I have gotten admission to a highly ranked university in USA with a course curriculum that is perfectly aligned with my future plans of Pakistan, 
After listening to that he was continuously seeing his computer screen, I guess he must be checking my previous interview experiences,
After a few minutes, he told me I cannot approve your visa the reason is the same as before, 
I said is it permanent rejection as this is my 7th attempt, 
He said, you have too many rejections and you need to change the circumstances. 
I left the counter.
I thought to change my sponsor and added my mother as my sponsor in my DS160. I thought to try changing sponsor so maybe it could work. 
8th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 11/08/2021 / 10:15 Am
VO was a big beard guy with his 50-55. 
Me: Hi sir, how are you doing?
VO: good morning, can you please scan your fingerprints.
I did, then VO told me to pass my documents. 
VO: what is the purpose of your trip?
Me: I am going to us to pursue master's in project management from northeastern uni, Boston.
VO: who will bear the expenses?
Me: My parents.
VO: What do they do?
Told about the parent business and job. In the end I said, we have a savings of 52k$. Do you want to see the bank statement?
VO: no, not needed.
VO: Have you ever visited any country?
Me: No, I never visited any country.
VO: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Me: Yes I do have.
VO: what do they do?
Me: One of my brothers is a chemical engineer and working as senior chemical eng in service industries, other siblings are still studying.
Then he started typing and after 30-45 seconds he said, Us laws are really strict and I cannot approve your visa.
I said, sir, is there anything wrong with my profile as this is my 8th attempt for f1 visa? 
VO: there is nothing wrong with your profile and you did not change anything in your profile.
I said I have changed my sponsor this time as I added my mother to my sponsor list.
VO: sorry.
I said thank you and left the counter.
After this attempt, I decided to change my university and reapply again.  I was also thinking to change the embassy but dropped off this plan as in my point of view embassy does not matter at all. 
I deferred my admission to Depaul university to spring intake 2022 and applied for the i20. I got an electronic i20 at the end of august and paid the fee again for the appointment.
9th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Depaul University, Chicago
Course: Master of Science in business analytics ($6k scholarship)
Intake: Spring 2022
Status: Approved
Date&time: 17/09/2021 / 8:00 Am
Vo was a really great guy in his 50+. Before me, the visa of one girl got approved. Luckily, I did not see the bald guy there and there were two VO's that were taking the interviews. I observed they were approving visas for most of the candidates. I was the last one being interviewed in the embassy. My visa interviews went smoothly. 
Me: Good morning officer, how are you doing?
Vo: Hi, good.
Vo: Fingerprints, I said is it done? , he said yeah. 
Vo: So, Mr.... you were there before uhmm..... He scanned my DS160.
Me: Yes, my visa has been refused 3 times this year. I want to say something. Actually, last time visa officer told me to change something in my profile and reapply. Now, I have changed my university with a more popular and advanced STEM degree that has a promising career in Pakistan. My intentions are to get my master's degree from the USA and come back to Pakistan to work as a business analyst in one of my dream companies that is Nestle. 
Vo: hmmm...
Vo: He was seeing the previous visa officer's comments on his screen, he got up and went back to talk with someone, I guess he was speaking about the visa officer who had rejected me before. He made some funny comments with his colleague and smiling.
Vo: So, you have applied to this embassy?
Me: Yes, I have applied to the ISL embassy. 
Vo: Have you ever applied to the KHI embassy?
Me: No, never. 
Vo: He scanned my ds160 3-4 times. I don't know why. He then wrote down his comments. After some time, Ok Mr.... you are good to go, your visa has been approved and you will get your passport within 5 days. He returned back i20, ds160, blue sheet(Approval sheet) and put my passport in the basket.
Me; Thanks, officer, thank you so much. 
Vo: Have a nice stay in the states while smiling. 
Me: Inside me( yeah yeah buddy why not).
I was literally crying when I was leaving the embassy, it was like a dream come true for me. 
I would like to thanks a few members of this group who helped me a lot during my interview experiences.

F-1
Rutgers University, Newark
Masters in Peace and Conflict
Program start date: 30th Aug
Classes start date: 6th Sep
Appointment Time: 9:00 A.M, Sep 2
Interview Time: 12:40 a.m
VO was the lady with glasses.
Questions:
VO: Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going for my Masters in Peace and Conflict Studies
Which University?
Me: Rutgers University, Newark Campus
VO: To which other Universities you applied?
Me: Michigan State University and Georgia State University
VO: Who will sponsor you?
Me: My father
VO: What does he do?
Me: Construction Business and owns rental properties
VO: How many employees?
Me: 35
VO: What is your age?
Me: 32
VO: No, You are not 32...( I was like what the heck)
VO was typing for a few seconds
VO: We are sorry but you are not eligible this time.
I was given yellow slip of Failure to establish ties.
I was really interested in this program because it was a sociological and anthropological approach to Peace and Conflict studies which is rare.
VO didn't check my documents. She didn't even look at my I20 and Passport thoroughly. She was looking at the screen, the whole time, and asking questions very rapidly. She even didn't look at my documents. I applied by myself to all universities and was selected in all of them. I filled my dS-160 my self. I reviewed my whole application by US friends who went on F1 visas and nationals as well. I had every document prepared for strong ties including Property documents. The list of documents were as follows;
1. Passport
2. CNIC
3. Appointment Confrimation Page
4. Appointment Fee Payment Receipt (Allied Bank Receipt)
5. DS-160 Confirmation Page
6. SEVIS fee Payment Confirmation
7. I20
8. Admission Letter
9. Bank Statement
10. Original Academic Documents
11. Resume
12. FRC
13. Residential Certificate
14. Police Clearance
15. Fard Nama of my Father's property (Only Translated Document in English)
16. Property Evaluation Letter
17. 2×2 Passport Photos (White Background)
18. Parents' CNIC Photocopies
19. Late Arrival Letter
20. IELTS
21. Birth Certificate
22. Experience and Approval Certificate from the NGO where I work
23. COVID-Vaccination
I was fully prepared and confident because I had a very strong profile but she didn't even check a single document. Well, I don't know the reason. May be her mood was off as she was interviewing Afghan immigrants before me for immigration visa and it took a lot of time. My prospective interview time of 10:15 a.m was delayed to 12:40 p.m. Hence, I came under fire.  
Sorry but its a shame.
This group helped me a lot in preparation. I feel awkward and kind of bad because there was no deficiency on my behalf. I am confused and need some insight for next applies. I will go for funded programs this time so that the only chance of rejection is also eliminated. I will also consider applying for funded PhD political science programs. I will really appreciate any kind of helpful guidelines. 
Thank you.

Good morning officer.

Me: I am going to attend Master's in Career Counseling from Florida State University. 
VO: It says it is a educational specialist degree program?
Me: Yeah it's both master's and specialist degree program. 
VO: Why career counseling?
Me: Because it's the need of the time. And I have personally struggled with career decision-making difficulties when I was done with high school.  That's why I did my bachelor's thesis on career decision making difficulties among adolescents. 
VO: And why Florida State University?
Me: Florida state university is one of the few universities offering both Master's and specialized degree program in Career counseling. It has also funded me through an assistantship in career center of the university. It's covering my tuition fee. The VO didn't let me complete and asked
Yeah you have an assistantship but you still have to pay for expenses how are you going to do that?
Me: Yeah absolutely I have to cover the rest and my uncle is paying for the cost of living. 
VO: What does your uncle do?
Me: He's a professor in a college in Abbottabad
VO: College?
Me: That's a medical college.

Me: Well my uncle is my legal guardian. He's been so invested in my studies since the beginning in fact he himself did his Ph.D. from university of Glasgow and he wants me to have an international exposure too. 
VO: Oh right, Do you have any relatives in U.S?
Me: No 
After 10 seconds pause, he handed me a blue slip. 
VO with a smile: Your visa is approved. You can take your documents.

Alhamdulilah! I 
got accepted to Fully Funded Masters 
Scholarship in Computer Science from 
Canada
 as well as 
America
.
HOW YOU CAN GET IT AS WELL?
1 line answer is: "" Good and Novel Research Work "" (Publication is not required).
A bit of 
detailed method
 (How I got the scholarship):
I have 
3.3 CGPA, and NO Publications
 but my research work is meaningful that I could write about it thoroughly in my Statement of Purpose.
Conduct good and meaningful research work in your home country (it means come with a problem and spend a few months or a year in solving that problem or problems in a good university or research lab under other professors, who can guide you).
Apply in Masters Thesis Programs only.
Write Statement of Purpose which should mainly focus on your research work and future prospects and reflects why this particular professor and university is the best match with your work (relate your work with prospective supervisor in the SOP, write his research paper titles and relate it with yours in 1-2 lines).
Get 3 Letters of Recommendations from your university (these letters should support and highlight your research work and what you have written in your SOP, it should not be generic at all (as most university professors give generic letters and they are useless).
Now, Choose universities you intend to apply based on your CGPA (like if you have just 3.0, then University of Toronto's scholarship doesn't make sense in your case) and follow these steps.
Visit Faculty profiles (related to your desired department of study), of let's say 20 different universities.
See the Google scholar and Personal Website of the Professors of that department you want to apply in. 
List down which 3 professors best matches with your research work and domain in those universities.
If there is no professor which matches with your research work, then do not apply in that university.
Write about his work and relate that to your work in your SOP.
Write him an email as well (after applying) that how his work was related and how you can assist him in his work and how his work fascinates you.
It would need you to read Abstracts of his recent research papers (to write, and relate such things in SOP)
Weightage to this method is 50% and 
rest of the 50%
 is Praying to Allah
Now Wait and be good to others. 
GREAT THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES AND HELP OTHERS.

Visa Interview Experience 
Profile: PhD Nutrition funded by Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. University of Minnesota.
Visa: J
Status: Accepted
In 
first window the guy verified my documents, checked my passport and pictures. Asked me if im married and asked about how long ago the picture was taken.
In second window my biometric was done
Then i waited for another 20 mins for my turn for final interview. My interview guy was bald man and he was older in age.
VO: Why are you going to US?
Me: To do my PhD in Nutrition 
VO: Why this university?
Me: I have worked a lot on nutraceuticals and superfoods. When choosing a university i wanted that my phd research is also around one superfood. So now I’ll be working on soy beans. Also the courses here at UMN are those that i am already familiar with but still need to gain technical expertise in. Like food analysis and food safety. And i have heard minneapolis is a beautiful city.
VO: ok ok and who is funding you?
Me: HEC
VO: I see that its partly funded by your university.
Me: Yes partly funded by university and rest by HEC so its completely funded.
VO: okay great. Congratulations. Enjoy your stay. Read the rules…… (couldn’t hear anything further as i was already crying almost)
I took the blue slip, my documents and almost ran out of the hall (as if he would catch me and give my passport back 
)
I was confident, i made sure that my answes are related to my research and reflect me and not any general answer. This is the key i think. Thank You everyone for all the support that I got.

Me: Okay here you go. (I also ended up giving both their passport copies)
VO: Oh so theyre separate people, not married to each other?
Me: Oh no no, theyre both separate people, not related.
VO: Where do they live?
Me: My uncle lives here in (my city) at ____ and my aunt lives in ____ (abroad, not US)
VO: (She sifted through everything; the bank statements, my I20, and was carefully reading even the affidavit. I should highlight here that I assume my last two rejections for the B1/B2 visa were because of my finances, which is probably why she was carefully reading everything in my case. Just my opinion.)
VO: Alright I see you have enough for one academic year. What about your second year?
Me: Yes, I have the Dean’s scholarship well into my second year as well, and my uncle and aunt will continue to support me.
VO: Okay.
(Then she was reading through something on the screen. She was doing this a lot during my interview and overall for others too maybe, cause other people were standing idly by her counter as well for a while.)
VO: I see you have previous rejections, was that trip for the USMLE? (many interviewees that day were going for their USMLE Step 3 or clinical rotations, just btw)
Me: Um, not exactly. I was also going for my clinical electives at ______ (this is a top ranked university in the US) where I had the chance to work with Dr ____ and another clinical elective at ______ (a famous research hospital in the US) to work with Dr ____. (I was excitedly telling her about the Drs because I genuinely find them both to be amazing)
VO: Are you not giving USMLE now?
Me: No. As I said, I am not pursuing a clinical career anymore. Im pursuing research.
VO: (I don’t recall the exact question. She asked me to elaborate on my career change. Like why I wasn’t practicing as a medical doctor and why I’m currently pursuing this degree and research?)
(I told her about when I switched and what led me to change my career to research. I just answered honestly.)
VO: How have your circumstances changed since then?
(I got confused because I thought I already elaborated on my career change so I mentioned it again and how this is for a masters degree.)
VO: No, what has changed? Did your sponsors not fund your trip last time?
Me: Oh no, my aunt and uncle weren’t my sponsors then. It was my father. He was sponsoring my trip last time.
VO: What do your parents do?
VO: How come your aunt and uncle are sponsoring you this time? How did that happen? (again, I don’t remember her exact words but she wanted me to elaborate why I made this change and how my aunt and uncle came to be my sponsors this time)
(I explained how they became my sponsors. They have been supportive of me throughout my application cycle and offered to fund my education. And I accepted.)
VO: Okay.
(Then she kept reading something. Kept scanning my passport. Was mostly looking at her screen during my interview. This felt like forever.)
VO: Alright, everything looks okay.
(Now this I was unprepared for, what should I say now lol. Should I say thanks or okay? So I just kept quiet lol)
VO: Im approving your visa! (Then she went on to explain how I will get my passport in 3-5 days, that she will keep my passport but return my I20 and SEVIS page. How I should keep this safe and make sure to bring it with me while travelling for the US Port of Entry I guess. I was in sheer shock so I was just blankly staring)
Me: Thank you! Thank you, hope you have a wonderful day ahead!
Took my documents and my folder and just rushed out.
The interview was longggg, as you can read. My VO was taking long interviews of nearly everyone I could see in that counter but it was not necessarily a bad thing. A lot of them were approved; you just had to be concise in your answers. The length itself can be intimidating, but if you’re honest and you’ve done your homework it will go well inshaAllah.
My brothers were a great source of help for me. They conducted my mock interviews and helped me throughout. One of my brothers is on an F1 visa in the US and I mentioned it in the DS160 form as well. But as you can read, she asked me nothing about that. I even mentioned an uncle in the US in my previous DS160 form for my B1/B2 applications, but she asked nothing about that either.
I reached out to many Pakistani students in the US through friends and friends of friends who all told me about their visa experiences and how it’s so straightforward and nothing to worry about. They were all super supportive and encouraging as well.
I used this group and the F1 visa experiences group on facebook a lot to gauge the kind of questions I could be asked and to learn from other people’s experiences. I made it a point to read mostly the approved posts. The rejected posts, though a lot more in number, serve to discourage and demotivate you. But yes, you can also learn from them. I still suggest reading mostly the approved posts. I even reached out to 
Rana Ibrar
 who was so gracious with his time and advice and guided me. He conducted a mock interview, told me about all possible questions, and was overall very motivating. He basically said: Your visa is approved! Long before I heard it in the consulate lol. JazakAllah Abrar!
Good luck to everyone applying. The 3Cs mentioned in this group’s featured post is spot on, and you will find anyone on the internet saying the same. Your finances, credibility as a student, and your commitment to the course and country and laws is what’s important. Which they will gauge from your interview mostly. If you are a genuine student and your finances are in order you should have no problem getting that visa inshaAllah.

Dear Group Members,
One of the professors from University of Florida has accepted me to enroll in a PhD project under her supervision. The project is fully funded. Also, she has offered me to work as a teaching assistant at the department as well. 
Currently, I am clueless about the next steps (e.g., Visa processing and documentation). I would really appreciate if you all could guide me on the following points:
1) 
What type of visa options are available in my case? I am married and would take my spouse with me.
2) Besides degrees, passport and acceptance letter, what other documents would be needed?
3) How long does the whole process take?

Hello everyone
Received my F1 visa mere in a week in the first attempt. My experience of interview and message to those who are appearing for the interviews in coming days.
Interview was too simple and to the point. It was as follow:
VO:  
Hello 
Me: Greetings
VO: Pass me your documents 
Me: Hand over all the essential documents which embassy guys gather and put in the passport at the embassy gate
VO: Why you are going to USA?
Me: Could answer the other way too, but simply responded as for my doctorate degree
VO: In which university 
Me: Replied
VO: Did you find any supervisor? Alhough my I20 was with her but she still asked this question
Me: Replied
VO: Can you please tell the name of your supervisor. She asked about spelling of my supervisor name twice. 
Me: Replied
VO: Whats your major?
Me: Replied, while telling her about the major i got a point to let her know that my MS is also in the same major. Anyway briefed her and she looks satisfied
VO: Started working on pc for quite a time and told me to wait please. It took couple of mins as she was typing something continuously. 
Me: At this moment I was like man I am gonna get visa today. But she turned to me and hand over pink card and wait for the response. I didn’t hear at that moment properly  whether she was telling me to wait for the mail or anything else. Anyway said goodbye to her but she kept my passport. On the pink card word refused was written but it also mentioned about Administrative Process too. I had kinda mix feelings that time but was quite optimistic ad confident too. 
The things i noted while going through this whole process was the confidence of students that does more natters. I have seen boys shaking while walking in the embassy. Even there was a guy in my lane outside the main building of Embassy in Isb and some other guy was asking hi something and the first guy responded like man don’t talk here as they observe us through cameras. This is too much.
So be confident while appearing for the interview. Moreover, they didn’t ask me for any extra document apart from the essential and neither I was asked to submit any document via mail. It was a smooth process and got my VISA mere in 7 days. 
Cheers

Me: Thank you.
Thanks.
Important points you should consider before applying for the F1 visa.
1)If you going for studies in the USA then you have to do the entire process without the support of any consultant, otherwise, your visa will be rejected.
2)You have to be very confident while you are communicating with the visa officer.
3) Your dress matters a lot, always prefer to wear simple and dark-colored clothes for the visa interview.
4)Always try to work on your grooming if you are planning for the visa interview (Beard, Hair Cut, Hair Colour, and Clean Shave) Everything should be up to date.
5) Try to keep a smile on your face while giving the interview.
6) If you do not know how to apply to a US university or even how to apply for a visa then you have to select the other country, USA is not the right place for you. Your input really matters.
7) Stop giving answers in YES or NO (Your answer should be at least one line).
Thank you so much Rana Ibrar and Mahwish Moazzam for your continuous effort and support. That was impossible without your assistance. God Bless you.

I asked her ""Actually my classes are going to start on the 23rd of August.""
She said in an apologetic way ""I am sorry but we have to follow the process""
Also, she gave me back my passport.

Do I have a chance to get a visa in 2-3 months so I can join the spring semester? Because I think the Fall semester is impossible for me?

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Embassy: Islamabad
Status : Approved
Applied by myself
After greeting, VO said my name and I nodded in response
Why are you going to US
I'm going for studies
You're going to Harvard. Great. What are you going to study?
Differential equations
Differential equations?
Yes, my concentration is differential equations although it says liberal arts on the document.
Why do you want to study these?
I'm a teacher and need to learn them so I can teach it to my students.
How was the application process?
(VO was asking about admission application and I thought he meant visa application) Most people said I should get an advisor or counsellor but I did it myself, didn't find it very complicated.
(VO interrupted) 
Did you apply and get accepted for it or just signed up?
I had to apply and go through the admission process.
OK. How do you plan to pay for it?
From my savings.
How much  do you have?
I shared the amount.
Are you married?
Yes
Any kids?
No.
Is your wife going with you?
No she's not. (I wanted to explain why, but didn't)
Have you changed your name before?
No, I haven't.
OK. It says you were Akmal (not real name) before?
My family calls me that endearly. It hasn't been my official name. 
OK I'm approving your visa. You'll get your passport in some days.
I asked how long it will take and he said its on the blue slip.
VO kept typing throughtout these questions and there were long pauses between questions. He didn't ask me for any supporting documents apart from the usual sevis fee, visa fee, DS 160 and Passport.
I was very nervous because he refused 3 people before me and only one approval. At the last minute I told myself that this person is a gatekeeper and I have to go to US nomatterwhat. I focused on why I was there and where I wanted to be, instead of focusing on people around me. Confidence is key. He could have refused me for my ans to last question but I clarified and was confident which I think helped.
ایسا لگ رہا ہے جیسے برسوں کا بوجھ ہٹ گیا ہو۔ 
I was refused visa for UK 4 years ago despite having an offer from University of Cambridge and it took me 3 years to save the money for this program.
I'd like to thank Tahir Haneef for helping me clear my doubts and for questions I had. I'd also like to thank you all for this group and the moderators. I did multiple mock interviews using different questions from previous posts here.
BTW nobody tells you about the whole gruesome process of going to shuttle stop, the exorbitant fee for it, multiple queues and security checks. The embassy building is daunting. Also, from the moment I stepped out of embassy to until I left the shuttle stop, every person I met asked me for mithayi after seeing the blue slip. I hope our workers learn some self respect and stop the begging.

Hi all,
I am J1 applicant. Visa officer took my passport but visa status is refused untill administrative process is completed. My start date is already expired and University provided me new Ds-2019 stating extended joining date. 
To note, embassy did not ask me to submit new ds-2019, yet University sent new form as joining date was exprired. 
My question is, should I send new ds-2019 to embassy even though they did not ask or should I wait for their directions?
Thanks for suggestions.

Sorry for the delayed post. 
I got my visa Approved on the 15th of August. Got my Passport after 15 days.
Islambad Embassy
The Officer was Long beard Guy.
Indiana Institute of Tech
The interview was pretty quick and straightforward.
Who is your sponsor?
Father's business?
How many branches?
How many Employees?
Why Gap?
Have you been to the U.S before?
Is it an Online Institution?
That was about it I guess If I remember correctly. I just wanted to post here because I used to read people's stories and get inspired to an extent so I thought it was my obligation to do the same.
There are no tricks Guys. Just know your stuff.
Read as much as possible about your course, your university, your Gap if any, and your sponsor's business (how many employees, the total income etc). The more you read about your stuff the more confident you will be.
Just be confident, be fluent. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's going to a 2-3 minutes interview that will change your life. 
One more thing, don't think about 2nd attempt. Consider your first attempt the last one and get the visa.
Good Luck!

Interviewer was a short haired blondie on counter 3
***PS. The interview was long as I tried to drag it as much as possible, so I will try to write as much as I can remember bear with the long post I hope it can be helpful***
Me: Hello
VO: Hey, how are you?
Me: I am good, I hope you are doing well too.
VO: thank you, May I have your picture
Me: Sure, here you go?
VO: How much time has passed since you got this captured?
Me: Maybe 2 months or a little over I don’t remember exactly.
VO: Is your picture edited?
Me: Oh yes, I guess it is as I got it taken at a studio
VO: Alright, may I have your documents please?
Me: You mean the bundle they made at first security check?
VO: Yeah that’s the one
Me: Here you go!
VO: Thank you (takes a glance at my documents and started typing away on her computer vigorously)
Me: Pleasure is all mine!
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going for higher studies, masters in civil engineering precisely.
VO: (continues typing while asking) Which university did you applied to?
Me: Oh I applied to 4 universities and got accepted at Lamar university
VO: Where else did you applied to?
Me: I applied at 3 other universities *told the names*, I originally planned to go for bridgeford but the communication with them was not so efficient and Lamar had swift responses so I thought why not!
VO: Can you tell me about your bachelors course?
Me: You mean the whole curriculum or the background of what it was about?
VO: Yeah the background (still focusing on her computer)
***BTW a handful tip try to get the interviewers’ attention because that is actually an indication that she is interested in knowing about you and most likely to grant you a visa so stop making robotic internet responses come up with your own originality***
Me: I explained about my bachelors and research major
VO: Ok so who is funding your studies?
Me: Well ofcorse my father is funding my studies as I am a student and I don’t work plus I also was able to get scholarship on merit basis
VO: What does your father do?
Me: He is a businessman
VO: What kind of business he runs?
Me: Oh he rents out heavy machineries for road carpet finish and supplies bitumen.
VO: Sorry, what bitumen?
Me: Uh you know the finish product of the road, small black rocks used for carpeting the roads.
VO: Oh yeah I got that, so why did you chose civil engineering for masters?
(She was continuously typing at this point too and I was trying to drag the convo as much as I can so she can start talking to me actually face to face)
Me: Ok so the story goes way long back, my father supported and encouraged me a lot regarding my education and such as I have no brother he placed all his expectations on me in this regard and trained me for such so that when I grow up I can help him with the business handling and that’s the reason it became my passion to actually learn about what my father does and to help him improve I wanted to learn about it from a worldly aspect so that we can adapt the technology and methods used around the world.
VO: Oh wow that’s cool!
(She glanced at me and started typing away again and I stood there waiting but seconds felt like hours and it felt like the pause was too long so I started talking again)
Me: While doing my thesis I got lucky and my bachelors research preprint got published too which was a milestone for me.
VO: (finally she leave her computer leaned on the table and turned her whole attention towards me and that felt like an achievement at that moment TBH) Tell me more about it.
Me: So my research was about the airport management at Karachi Jinnah Intl Airport and its aspects.
VO: How is airport management related to what you want to study?
Me: Yeah the infrastructure and management aspect you know.
VO: Ohhh now that’s cool, Congratulations your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you!
***She was giving me the yellow approval slip alongwith my documents bundle from the small window and suddenly stopped either ends of the documents in each of our hands***
VO: When does your classes start?
Me: Oh they start from 17th Jan 2023.
VO: Alright you are free to go
(I took the document and went straight outside without seeing back and out where I cam from in)
***Remember you can be nervous it doesn’t matters because the officers are well aware of that no matter how hard you try to hide it it’s just going to get worse so do not bother with that but don’t lose your composure in the process this is the thing you need to work on. Never ever express your gratitudes and emotions and joyness when your visa gets approved as it is going to convey that you are desperate and most highly chance of getting rejected because they can do it that is what they are checking from the very beginning till the end, they are not interested in you because of all those robotic answers they hear all day long so make them actually talk to you, and last but not the least recite some duas for ease all the time on the way to the embassy till you stand in front of the interviewer, don’t think about acception or rejection that’s the main thing and you will automatically start to talk without any hesitation***
That’s all for now if you have any further questions feel free to ring my inbox and best of luck for thise who have upcoming interviews believe in Allah have faith in yourself and ace the interview afterall you are paying a hefty amount just to get to talk with the person and still you have to be nervous from thise who are taking your money, give yourself a prep talk and you are good to go.

Interview experience. F1 visa. Karachi Embassy.
Alhamdulillah got my visa approved.
They only asked for my DS 160 confirmation,SEVIS, I20 and most recent passport at the entrance. Visa officer also checked only these. Didn't ask for anything else.
VO: 
Morning
Me: Morning
Then he asked for the finger-scanning. I did it. Then he asked the first question.
Why MBA?
I was about to answer and he interrupted, ""something went wrong with prints, we will have to repeat.""
This did throw me a bit as it disrupted my thoughts flow. But I scanned my fingers again and then he repeated same question.
VO: Why MBA?
Me: I answered, it was based on personal details.
VO: Why this university?
Me: Multiple reasons. It has really good marketing program, something I am interested in majoring. It also has a cool academies program. Where students get one to one mentorship and get to work on real life business cases. Also it's somewhere I have previously attended a summer exchange program at 6 years ago. And finally, they give a really good financial aid package.
VO: (Looked at my I20). So who is paying for it?
Me: Like I said I have really good financial aid package. And for the rest I have taken out a student loan.
VO: Did you get the loan from Pakistan?
Me: No, prodigy finance.
VO: Based on what information did they approve your loan?
Me: Oh just my employment history, bank history and credit score.
VO: Do you have friends or family in USA?
Me: No, first one from my family to be going there.
VO: That's nice.
Then he typed for like a full minute or 2 which felt like ages and then said, congratulations, your visa has been approved. You will get an email when your passport is ready to be collected.
He also handed me a yellow slip saying my visa is approved and how will I collect it.
PS:. From what I read here, I thought yellow was administrative processing and blue was approval. But approval is yellow.

Me: Sir I am also flabbergasted that what is happening for the last two times, there must have been some communication gap.
Vo: If it seems to you that some officers are older and have better judgement and the younger one's doesn't. You are wrong, we all have the same training and judgment skills. Last time you appeared 13 days before, am I right?
Me: Yes
Vo: (Passed me the yellow slip and took his keyboard aside and get his mike near to mouth and spoke with very harsh behavior that) 
Let me explain you the F1 visa process. It is not a lottery that you are applying again and again. I am not saying zero (while making the hand gesture) but there are 99.99 percent chances that your visa is going to be refused until or unless some major changing happens in your profile. So, I'll suggest you to not waste your money by applying again and again. 
Lesson Learned:
- It was just not my day.

FORTH ATTEMPT
Interview date: 11th Jan
Class start date: 11th Jan
Didn't have late arrival letter.
VO was a Beard Guy.
Me: Hello Sir How are you?
Vo: I am fine, how are you?
Me: I am good.
Vo: Ok, why are you going to USA?
Me: I am going to do Masters in Civil Engineering at Texas Tech University. 
Vo: Have you applied in any other university?
Me: Yes i did apply in four other universities (named all of them) and got two acceptances. I have another I20 if you like to see.
Vo: No, Who is your sponsor and what does he do?
Me: Told in detail
Vo: How many siblings do you have?
Me: I have one elder brother who is a doctor by profession and a younger sister who just engaged last week and going to be married soon. So, ultimately I am the only dependent child of my parents.
Vo: You work at xyz company, what is your role there?
Me: Told
Vo: (asked another question I don't remember)
Me: I replied to that question  and in addition I also mention him that the reason why I am emphasizing again and again on going to USA is because being a Civil Engineer I know that in Pakistan we follow the American Building Codes and American Standard Testing Machines, so it would be completely waste of time and money for me to consider other country as my post-grad destination.
Vo: (Already started typing) Ok you make sense to me. I am approving you visa and passed me the blue slip.
Lesson Learned:
- Don't loose hope.
I know all of us are fighting our untold battles due to which more often we experience anxiety attacks which sometimes even lead us to the feelings of existential crisis. I would say don't get your energies drained by mere affairs of this materialistic world. What happens, it has to happen. Trust the procedure.......I do know its cliche to say all of this but i hope this approch might help one day.

Congrats, I am approving your visa! 
I was shocked at what is happening...
VO already rejected 4 students in front of me after a full detailed interview..
And I want to tell you one thing interesting ... I was in the line where VO was a lady and she was rejecting everyone and rejecting 4,5 students already...When she calls me for an interview I skipped the line...Their security officer asked me why I skip the line?. I said I feel hesitant in front of the lady officer 
...He said okayy and allow me to give my interview to the male Visa officer..
It was quick barely 2 minutes. I was prepared and confident enough. 
Serious suggestion:- Be confident with a smiling face and don't hesitate... VO wants to give VISA if you are confident...
Thanks...

Subject = Master in Health care management. .
Details.
I am a  nurse by profession, 
I 
told my consultant that I need to get admission in  Master of science in Nursing , My consultant satisfied me that he will get my admission easily, because I have a strong profile, then I was a gree and deposit money ,but after two months my consultant told me that getting admission in master in nursing is impossible for Pakistani students, I was in shock to hear,My consultant then told me that I have only option to take admission in (master in health care management) so I decided to say yes because I have no any other option .
When my I 20 form release by university they mentioned my major is MBA , when I ask from my consultant does it make Sense because my major is Master in health care management, My consultant told me that don't wory master in health care management come under MBA category.
During today interview my interviewer ask me
My major is MBA , which is mentioned in I 20  form.
I justify my Answer that I am going to persue master in health care management which come under the MBA category, 
But the expression of interviewer changed and give me yellow slip .
So I request those all students ,please don't go to any consultancy ,they have only one aim to grab your money , they don't care about your future it all.
Because if your subject is changed from your previous degree then it doesn't make sense to the interviewer that you are a genuine student ,because they need a weak point in your profile to reject you easily.

Students before me for undergraduate programs were rejected and one student for masters degree was accepted only. 
Me: Good Morning officer!
Him: Why this course?
Me: I chose bs business administration as i belong to a business related family, my father and brother both are successful businessmen, i have interest in business as this course will enhance my business skills as ill learn about all aspects of business including economics, marketing, supply chain and information system 
He gave a smile, seemed like he thought i was confident abt my program like know how, and stood up took my passport inside and came back
Him:Why this university?
 I did an internship at an educational consultancy where i got to know about university of UTAH then i did my research and got to know about unique majors that university is providing and big campus situated in 1526 acres, diversification of students, support system for students, i got scholarship of 35000$ across 4 years and last factor was location, which is salt lake city, it is one of the liveable cities in US and top preference for international student because of the business opportunities.
Passed me my docs with rejection slip and said sorry you’re not eligible for the visa under section 214B. 
Can anyone guide me where i went wrong as I cant seem to understand with only two questions how he rejected me. My D160 was perfect also funding and my family ties are also good as I’ll have to come back to takeover my family business. 
Ps: i applied on basis of my o level grades

US visa interview Analysis
I have been reading posts from students getting visa rejections. Generally there are lot of common red flags that even we are able to spot. 
When it comes to visa interview, first of all your whole picture is important. That includes your body language, your confidence and positivity, and your clear and concise communication. 
For starters, don’t fear the rejection and be hopeful, trust yourself if you have done your homework well. Don’t try to flatter 
or give long answers, only tell what are you asked and answer the question directly, no hereabouts or background stories. Communicate very clearly so that they are able to hear and understand you.
This was about communication and first impressions. Now, for the interview there are certain things that every visa officer wants to know. 
I made an easy to remember guide. Have you consider what can be 3 C’s for a visa interview? Have you wondered what visa officers are actually assessing? It’s only 3 things, and all their questions revolve around these.
The 3 C’s of visa interview: Credibility, cost and commitment 
Credibility means you have to establish that you are a genuine student, have study related goals, and your profile is sound. The university you chose suits your educational needs and is not just a random university to get a way out. You are not hiding anything, and you are showing exactly who you are. 
To sum up, your academic profile, your spoken skills, and the university you chose matters a lot
Cost means that you are financially secure and able to fund your studies. This part becomes easier if you have a fully funded scholarship. In all other cases you need to show a strong financial sponsorship which is legitimate. Your immediate family members can sponsor you and they should seem reasonably strong themselves to be able to support. Sponsorship from other relatives and a mismatch between the financial condition of sponsor and the bank statement becomes shady.
Lastly, commitment is the most important C, you won’t be able to dodge that easily. Commitment to your own self, your country and the US law. Commitment to yourself means you are passionate about your work and have sincere plans, you are not willing to use the education as an opportunity to run away from your area of study and choose something else when land in US. Commitment to the country, Meaning you have to show strong ties with your country and that you want to come back, you having a family or job back home is a good tie but that’s not enough. Make no mistake and keep your mind off of additional thoughts, VO will know if you are being tricky.
Last thing is commitment to law, sadly many students get involved in illegal jobs to support themselves or use petty tactics to get a citizenship and settle in the other country. This is in a violation of your visa status and VOs will read that. So be a responsible citizen and don’t show such signs in interview.
I will be hosting a live drop in session tomorrow evening in this group. Will be sharing these in more details and answer your questions if any.
All the best

Seniors
, please help me out in this matter. I really appreciate any help you can provide.
I applied for an F1 visa but got rejected in my first attempt. I'm going to try again, but I'm also engaged with a girl who has US citizen and could apply for a spouse visa. I still want to try for the F1 visa first. If I don't get it after two attempts, will it create any problem when I will apply for a different visa based on my spouse's sponsorship?
Thanks Again.

Hello All
I gave my visa interview for PhD on July 18
Case created: july 18
Case last  updated; july 19
Status: refused
Due 
to administrative processing 
VO asked me to submit additional documents like CV, study plan etc.which I submit within 2 days.
Since then my Visa status is refused.
I defer my semester as my classes start date was 28th August which I couldn't attend.
Can I book appointment again ? Or 
Should I wait for this administrative processing? 
Can anybody Please guide me.
"
215,"
Visa approved after 221g (administrative processing)
AOA
I finally received a visa after 40 days of administrative processing.
University: Cleveland State University
Sponsor: Cousin living in the US
Embassy: Islamabad
Interview date: 03 Aug 2022
Passport received: 20 Sep 2022
Interview experience: VO only asked about my program and current job while constantly typing. He was not asking anything else but just typing, I was telling him about my graduation, sponsor and future goals. He was just saying OK in reply. He then told me he will need some more information via email and returned my passport.
So, i want to share my experience what observed so far, it might be helpful for someone.
First and the most important thing is the believe in Allah and Duas from parents.
Practice interview in front of a mirror or laptop camera.
Prepare the answers to common questions from VO and analyze them until you get confidence that they are according to your case because only you know the best about yourself. Tell him like a story and show your accomplishments. No doubt, university and sponsorship matter but the most important thing that matters is how you are presenting your case if it makes sense then all OK. Your whole profile matter.
One last important thing which we often ignore, please be dressed as it depicts how serious you are about your study or the concerned post. They judge you from the very moment when you get up from the chair and move towards the window.
Best of luck all.
Thanks!

Karachi Consulate 
23rd November 
VO was Asian American
VO: 
Please pass your documents (passport and I20)
VO: Have you been to the US before?
Yes I went there with my family couple of years back.
VO: Why do you want to go now?
I want to pursue a master's degree in xyz program for abc university. 
VO: Why this program?
It is a growing field and related to my undergraduate degree as well as current job. 
VO: Who is your sponsor?
My sponsor is xyz and he has a business based in pakistan. (Gave some details of his business here to avoid usual follow up questions regarding sponsor. 
VO: Your visa is approved. 
The interview was of one minute at max. I had an upper hand because of being a issued a tourist visa earlier but most people were getting accepted that day. 
A few pointers for people who would be applying:
- Aim for universities that have a QS ranking of under 500. 
- Apply to multiple universities (3-5) as it shows the student's interest in studying. 
- Try applying to a field that is related to your current work experience or undergraduate degree. 
All they really see is the student's authenticity and his ability to come back after studies. If they have any doubt about the student staying there or going to earn money, they will reject your visa. 
All the best, may Allah make the process easy for everyone.

Embassy: Islamabad
Date: 12 May
Visa Status: Approved
I was a bit nervous and none of my answers went 100% smooth.
Here's how interview went.
VO: Hello(in very friendly tone)
Me: Hi
VO: (After taking my docs and entering them on PC) Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going to attend Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Cincinnati.
VO: (After a pause) Why did you choose this University?
Me: (I stuttered during this answer a bit) I am going because this university is aligned with my research interest.
VO: Why did you choose University of Cincinnati specifically?
Me: Because the lab facilities and faculty is suited to my research in additive manufacturing. It's the same research that I did in my bachelor's. (stuttered here too)
VO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father. (I stopped after saying this for around 20 secs and then started speaking again) He is manager at X and makes Y money through job Z money through rentals and some money thru real estate trading which I don't know how much is.
VO: Cograts. Enjoy your stay at united states.
Me: Thanks.
Thoughts? 
The visa doesn't mostly depend on the interview. The VO wasn't even listening to me with attention. It depends on your uni, course and any funding you have(I had $20k scholarship). My interview wasn't the best. Actually, I would say it was average or below average.
Almost all visas(5/5) got approved before me. Only 2 were refused, who went after me. Those 2 had genuine reasons to refuse. If I were VO, I would even refuse them(not cuz of hate lol but their case didn't seem strong on paper)
Suggestions?
1. Don't go for consultants. They apply for you at few unis which VOs are aware of. VOs don't even consider you in that case. They straight away reject you.
2. Take IELTS. Take GRE. Secure full/partial scholarship(you can easily get it). Then go for visa. You will get it InshAllah.

Interview date = 15 Aug
Status = approved 
V.O= long beard man
Time slot = 10.30 am
First Question = how many admits you got
Answer = i got admission in 3 out of 4 universities in which i applied. Unfortunately wasn’t able to make it to university of rochester. Also named the universities and their business schools in which i got admit
2nd = why this xyz university 
Ans= Told MSBA at xyz is ranked among top 100 MsBa programs in the world according to Qs rankings. Also told in detail about the diversity of curriculum 
3rd= how many brothers you have
Ans = told 1 and also about his profession
4Th= who is financing you
Ans= told i have got scholarship of about 5K and have personal savings of around 8k and the rest of cost which is almost 43 k is going to be paid by my father. 
He asked about his business and i gave him the details 
5th= he asked me about my mother’s sister who lives in US
Ans= i told him that i have no immediate relative but about other relatives I already had mentioned in my Ds-160. He didn’t bother about it because she lives in different state than the state in which I have got acceptance..
Conclusion = 
Before the start of interview i had got the confidence that I would get visa because VO gave quite time to a student before me and listened him comprehensively before rejecting his visa so i got the feeling that if he gives me that chance i ll have the chances to get the visa. No doubt it is game of luck . And also the VO who is quite young was also giving alot of opportunity to speak . Women VO had more interviews from non-F1 categories and she put most of these cases to administration processing

US F-1 Visa:
I had my Visa interview on 7th October. The interviewer gave me a Blue slip(Visa Approved) and said my Visa was approved and I should get my Visa in 7 days. It's more than a week now and I haven't received my Visa. Moreover, my status on CEAC website is 'Administrative processing'.And the last status update date is same as the interview date.
On the other hand some friends of mine who had Visa interview after 13th October, have received emails about their Visa 
delivery and their status on the CEAC website is 'ISSUED'
I am worried about it now because I have to enter US before 1st November according to the start date mentioned on my I-20. Does anyone have any idea about how much more time this Visa process can take?
Note: My Visa was approved and Interviewer himself told me that I shoul get the Visa in 7 days.
TIA

I need someone to guide or teach me for visa interview. Please comment whoever can guide in this matter. I‘d be happy to pay a fees as well.

I got accepted to USF(bachelors in CS) with about 12k USD scholarship/year. However, my family, at most, can contribute upto 5k USD per year. The total cost per year is about 32k USD, is it manageable to cover the rest of the costs with part time job?
P.S: I also will have to maintain my GPA to keep my scholarship valid for 4 years.

VO: Why do you want to go to the US?
Me: I want to start my bachelor's degree in cinematography and film/video production.
*The VO's facial expression made me understand that he was impressed with the field I wanted to pursue*
VO: Why do you want to study filmmaking? 
Me: Officer I come from a very artistic family, my father, mother, and sister, everyone is into arts, so I've always had a sense of appreciation toward all forms of art...
*The VO interrupted me*
VO: What kind of art does your father do?
Me: He likes to paint.
VO: Where does your sister live?
Me: I have a younger sister and she lives with us.
VO: What does your father do?
Me: My father is XYZ in XYZ company.

VO: Hmm...
VO: What will you do after completing your filmmaking degree?
Me: I will come back to Pakistan because I see a big gap that needs to be filled in here in the Pakistani film industry, everyone is working on genres like romance and comedy, but no one is working on Sci-Fi or classic drama. I wish to bring all of the knowledge and techniques of advanced filmmaking to Pakistan so that I could create projects to uplift the under-developing film industry of Pakistan.

I had my F1 visa interview on 29th March 2021. Although I got the visa approval slip (blue color) from the VO, my online visa checker shows the status of 'Refused'. I have already emailed this query to the embassy but still no response. Anybody else having the same issue? If yes, what is the possible solution and how can I check my true status?

My Visa is refused under 221g on 20th May and they require some additional documents. I submit the documents on 24th of May and I received an Auto response from the embassy attached below.
I think it's due the political protests in Islamabad in those days.
*Should I submit them documents again? Or they will consider my previous email.*

INTERVIEWER: INFAMOUS ASIAN
NO GRE
NO IELTS
GPA 2.86
Date: 8th June.
DISCLAIMER: My interview was very different from others so please don't take it as a guide as I don't want to mislead anyone.
After preparing myself for straight 20 days I went for an Interview, I was prepared for every kind of question, but there was something else written in my fate.
VO DID NOT ASK ANY COMMON QUESTIONS LIKE:
Why US? 
Why this university?
Rather he started like this
1) what are your daily responsibilities in your current job?
2) what does your father do? (Convinced with my one word ANSWER)
3) what are your plans after graduation? (Told him the names of 3 it companies name where I'm aiming to work at)
4) do you have any relatives? I said yes because I didn't want to lie
5) will you leave the current job? I said yes (btw I just joined that job 20 days ago)
Conclusion: All that time he was behaving as if the decision is already decided because he seemed too uninterested to hear my answers. It was like as if he was just completing a formality nothing else.
In a nutshell, for me US F1 VISA IS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON LUCK BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A HEC FUNDED PHD LEVEL GUY GETTING REJECTED WHOSE PROFILE WAS 4X STRONGER THAN MINE.
BUT GO WELL PREPARED AND BE CONFIDENT. I ALSO GREETED HIM IN A VERY LOUD VOICE. Also don't forget to pray and take your mother's prayers as they can do wonders.
GOODLUCK!
Thankyou 
Rana Ibrar

J1 and J2 visa 
#approved
J1 for the postdoc position at UW, Seattle
Took interview on 1st December along with two dependents (spouse and a 20-mo old toddler) at Isl Embassy 
Fingerprints were taken by a man who did ask about the height of spouse.
VO was a young lady 
J1 Interview questions were related to research focus during postdoc, funding from the supervisor, previous PhD research experience. Documents asked resume of j1, and postdoc supervisor along with research plan and offer letter
J2 interview questions were related to current job position in Pakistan, PhD research work and PhD funding (which was by Iran and we both did our PhD from Tehran University of Medical Sciences)
J2 toddler slept during the interview after throwing major tantrum before the interview.
J1 and J2 toddler's passport was kept by the visa officer. Ds2019 was signed and returned. No documents asked. Just told to wait.
J2 spouse's passport was returned back. He was given a slip with a QR code to be scanned asking for further documentation.
It referred to ds5535 which has major qs related to travel history.
J1 and the toddler got approved after 6 working days. No docs asked.
J2 spouse was approved 3 weeks after the approval of primary applicant.
J1 requested an updated ds2019 from the supervisor as the old one was no longer valid.
All this happened from 1 Dec to 15 Jan. I am bad at keeping dates for individual updates of the status history.

If you dont get accepted in US in the first try, rather than begging them in 2nd or 3rd try for a visa , just change your country because some of us are not born with silver spoons in our mouth , nor have any businesses to show ties.

Interview Experience:
She was a young American lady, we had a conversation for like 2 -3 minutes.

** I was being honest but I think that was a big mistake too because my brother has not visited pakistan since he went ( almost 2 years) but he's visiting next month now.
After that she gave me Yellow slip and said sorry can't give you visa due to immigration rules.
Now I have applied again this week at Karachi Embassy with the same profile ( DS160, Queens college NY, same course bachelor's in computer science) because I think I made mistakes in siblings section.
I need help and Answers , Where I was wrong and what changes should I make , I know this time officer is also going to ask me why was my VISA refused and what circumstances have you changed.
Your Answers can help me alot
Thanks 
Best of luck to all of you

Visa Category: F-1 Student Visa
Timing: 8:45am
Date: 09-12-2022
Counter no 4
Visa 
officer: Young American Lady.
Status: Visa Approved
Special Case: My Uncle in USA was my sponsor
IELTS: Band 8
Academics: A and O Level with 7 papers of ACCA all above 82% marks
University: University of Nebraska-Lincoln
No Greetings or Good morning
VO: Straight away, Pass me your documents
Me: Given
VO: Why are you going to USA
Me: I'm going to pursue further education in USA which is an Undergraduate Degree.
VO: Why specifically USA and were you looking for other destinations?
Me: I choose USA, since Australia is more expensive in terms of living cost and Canada doesn't have high quality education in comparison to USA. Additionally, USA has the most number of prestigious universities. Also, these universities offer practical courses with flexible education for students and cultural diversity in USA further enhances the educational experience. She then interrupted
VO: Why are you not continuing your ACCA in Pakistan and instead going for a Degree in USA.
Me: Firstly ACCA is a professional qualification and not a degree. personally I feel that ACCA is just the pure education,meanwhile a degree in USA will not only avail me with practical education but also enhance my communication skills as well. Secondly, I designed my career path in such a way that after getting this degree from USA, I will be eligible to get exemption of 6 papers from Pakistan so that's why I decided to pursue my education in USA and then complete ACCA after coming back to Pakistan.
VO: Why did you select this university?
Me: I conducted a whole research and I have a set of parameters through which I filtered a handful of universities and then finalized this one. Most important reason beside its high ranking in USA is it's accounting course structure.
VO: Then tell me something about this course, have you gone through the course catalog?
Me: The course speciality is that, it is divided into semester and each semester is based on two modules. Each module represents a skill set, so unlike other courses where we learn core accounting skills in last 2 years, this degree allows me to learn all these skills on the go from first year to last. And yes I have gone through course catalog as well.
VO: So what subjects are you really excited about from that course catalog
Me: I'm interested in Performance Management, Financial Reporting, Cost Accounting. After that She was typing in Keyboard then I said, I'm extremely passionate about accounting systems as well.
VO: Who is going to sponsor you?
Me: My Uncle is going to sponsor me, He own a business named HCGeeks.
VO:Tell me more about his business.
Me: He has an IT support business which offer multiple services like website designing, repair and maintenance... She interrupted me and ask another question.
VO: What did your father do and Why doesn't he sponsored you?
Me: My fathers owns a Gold Wholesale Business. This business is too traditional and all the payments and receipt are made in Gold. That's why my father was unable to provide a Bank Statement in Cash for last six months. Therefore, I'm using my uncle's bank statement as a proof of funds and he will be responsible to finance my entire stay in USA.
VO: Did your uncle have any dependent in USA?
Me: Yes he live with his family and have 2 daughters and a Son.
VO: Then How will he support Your education while looking for his family as well?
Me: All his children are under 12 years of age so by the time when he actually begins to finance the education of his children, my education will be finished till that time.
VO: Did you have any siblings?
Me: Yes, I have 2 sister and a brother. I'm the eldest.
VO: What are your future plans and how this degree will help?
Me: This degree is a milestone in itself, since it fulfils the credit hour requirement towards a professional qualification. So with the planned career path,In next 10 years I want to have at least 2 degrees, along with a professional accounting qualification. I envision myself working as the head of department or in a managerial position in relevant accounting firm.
VO: Did you meet any student of this university  or contacted professor?
Me: No, I wasn't in contact with student but I call their representative once to resolve one issue.
VO: I'm accepting Your Visa and She handed me a Yellow Slip.
Me: Thank You.
Tears were literally bubbling out of my eyes. As I was sitting in the waiting area after acceptance, two ladies thought that I was crying because I get rejected but then I showed them the acceptance slip. That was the moment of my life.
I was fully confident, the interview was very long around 10-13min and the Visa officer asked me lots of unorthodox questions, with every question she used to stare at me with sharp eyes but I maintained eye contact and was using my hand as well while replying to her questions.
I prepared a lot for this interview and I used to visualize myself in this condition. Every thing went very smooth and I tackled every single question without hesitation.
One tip is to make a possible list of question, then try to write a general answer first and then personalize that answer. It should sound that It's coming from a dedicated student have done his preparation and he cares about his future education.
Hope it helps.
JazakAllah

Hi guys, My visa was refused on 31 Jan the worst day of my life. I was not expecting that I was sure that I am a genuine student and that my profile is so strong my visa will not be refused but it is. I went into depression and couldn't even talk to my parents for a few days then I decided I am not gonna try again. I should switch to Australia and apply there. And I was scared that maybe my Australian visa will be refused because my USA visa is refused. I contacted many 
consultants they said It's not a big deal. I asked a few questions in this group and came to know that it's not a big deal many students got visas on the second attempt. So I gathered information from everyone and came to the point I should try again for the USA. because if my Australian visa is refused there will be no chance that my USA visa will be approved. So I defer my semester to fall 2023. So I want to know from you guys What I should change to my application?
Should I change university? All other students who applied to that uni got visa approval, not even a single one got a refusal.
Should I add another sponsor along with my father?
Those guys who got approval after rejection please tell me what you guys did.
Lastly, I want to tell you to say your interview did not go well which may be the reason. But my interview lasted for 15 minutes and I answered everything. But when I posted my experience in this group I realized that I made 1 to 2 mistakes but that's not a reason for refusal.

“ FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANTS TO APPLY FOR USA STUDENT VISA” 
I got all of questions in my inbox regarding US student visa so thought should write here to cater most audience. 
This text is divided into: Expense before and after getting visa, Visa approval and denial etc. 
Firstly, When you start planning to get your degree there are some of the cost you should keep in your mind.  
1: IELTS (40,000) approx
2: University Application Fees ( approx 30,000- 40,000) 
3: SEVIS ($350 -  50,000)
4: WES evaluation ($200 - 35,000) approx
5: Visa fees ( $160 - 29,000) 
Approximately one should have around 200,000 thousands (2 lac) in hand because these all fees are in dollars and varies with exchange rates. 
* THIS IS WHEN YOU ARE APPLYING ON YOUR OWN WITHOUT ANY CONSULTANT* 
Secondly, Visa is all about your luck. I have been rejected once and accepted in my next interview. I have changed nothing in filling out DS-160 for my second interview. It was luck that was with me that day but that doesn’t mean I didnt prepared. 
I prepared infront of mirror, practice to speak because english is our secondary language so to clear my pronunciation and to be confident I practice alot. I did mock interview from youtube. Read interviews of people. Make my own notes and keep changing it until I was fully sure about it. Thats how I manage to speak with confident. No matter if you are saying wrong or incorrect if you have confident you are good to go. 
I have seen people accepting and rejecting and be ready for any decision and if you didnt make it first time make sure that you give your 100% in your second attempt so that you dont have any doubt over yourself. 
People asked me that this amount or that amount is enough for our bank statement. I personaly believe amount should be minimum (50 lac) in your or your sponsor account to match the cost of attendance for your university. 
In my case my uncle was my sponsor. No matter eho is your sponsor make sure to prove the ties with that person in your interview. Make your point strong of wht that person is sponsoring you. Every case is different so make sure you have your point. 
You are allowed to work 20 hours a week on campus as a student. This amount is enough to bear your daily expense but with this amount you cant bear your tuition. Keep this in mind. 
 If you get visa make sure you have enough money for atleast 2- 3 month of your expense here in US. This includes your food, traveling, daily expense etc. 
Belive in yourself and Allah. If he have made you to embassy  so trust me your luck is with yoi because yoi are one in those thousand people who are selected to that university. 
*MY MOM USE TO SAY ME*
“BETA, Agar tumhare naseeb main jana likha hai tou koi rook nahin sakta or nahi likha tou koi cha kar bhe nahin bhej sakta* 
 Please write down your wuestion below in comment I will try my best to answer them. 
Thanks.

VO: So why do you want to go to USA?
Me: 
To Persue data sciences from XYZ university
VO: persue?
Me: I mean I want to study data sciences.
VO: why specifically US?
Me: because i see degrees from US highly compatible and respected in Pakistani corporate sector, alot of CEOs and department leads here have graduated from USA. Same is the case at my current organisation, and i want to follow the same career path. 
VO: did you change anything in your application this time?
Me: Yes, i have this job conditional confirmation letter from my current organisation, (I pushed it forward) do you wanna see it?
VO: (He didn't take it) Can you please tell me about it with some details?
Me: Sure, its a conditional letter where I have to complete my masters specific to only data sciences/analysis. And they will onboard me back at a senior position. 
VO: Oh great (when he said this I had my hopes up)
VO kept typing for 2-3 mins, i was expecting him to ask more questions based on my sponser and finances.
VO: unfortunately we cannot grant you visa, please do read it out(passed me the same slip)
Me: is there anything specific i can change if I'm applying again?
VO: all i can tell you is mentioned in this (pointed at the slip)
Me: I read it out very carefully the first time too. But sure, thankyou.
VO: you're welcome (gave me the pity smile lol)
I can't understand what to change, I have academic travel history, i showed strong ties with a standing job offer in Pakistan on my second attempt. Is there anything i can change, I will obviously change my university with a much better ranked one for the next term. But will this change be enough?
Should i go for the 3rd attempt this term? My classes starts on 29th August

VO: Why are you going to the US?

VO: Did you apply to any other universities?

VO: So you have a brother in the US?

VO: Why did you choose to pursue this program now?
ME: Well I graduated last year with my bachelors degree. Since then I've been working in a school as an English teacher. I was made HOD of the English department & I became interested in HR management. And since there weren't many good options for this degree in Pakistan, I thought why not go to the US.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME: My father is my sponsor.
VO: What does your sponsor do?
ME: He is a recently retired police officer from Punjab police. He currently owns a pharmacy business in Lahore.
VO: Ok, I'm approving your visa. 
I found the VO to be very professional. He would interrupt most my answers by saying ""Ok got it"" when he wanted me to stop talking and I would. I was honest and confident. That's the key. Also your choice of University really matters, in my opinion. 
3 guys were rejected before me. 1 girl who went before me was approved.  They were all re-applying. This was my first attempt.

Date: 24th May 2022
Status : Approved
First, outside the embassy at the window submitted my I-20, Passport, Photograph, I-20 payment slip. 
Secondly, went inside, gave my fingerprints and documents on two windows and then waited for my turn.
Thirdly, THE INTERVIEW
Questions of VO:
What program did you apply to?
How many universities did you apply to?
Who will sponsor your education?
How many siblings do you have?
Is any of your sibling abroad for studying?
What is their status in USA? (My brother is in USA)
Did you get any scholarship?
So these were the questions, to which I answered honestly, I believe they keep cross-checking you for lies because they could have asked a lot of questions regarding my degree but chose to ask for the family history. There was nothing to lie about.
Alhumdulillah !!

Interview Tip
According to EX Visa Officer.
The most important thing to have for your visa interview to be prepared is to have confidence. I would say 30 to 50 per cent of your visa approval or denied based on confidence so you want to make sure that you have that confidence.
 
How do you get that confidence?
You have to know exactly what kinds of questions will come up for your specific life situation. So prepare well for all the possible life scenarios. Throughout the interview, try to stay as positive as possible so that you appear polite, calm, and relaxed.

Me: Curriculum and instruction is my major which offers 14 different areas of concentration and ""Science Education"" is one of them. I chose this aea bcx it will broaden my current knowledge and experience also it ll help me improve myself scientifically and technologically to make a positive contribution in my community when I ll be back.
VO: Ok...so it's related to ""Education"".
Me: yes
VO: so you wana be teacher?
Me: A kind of...but I'm more interested to work as a trainer, bcx during my work as a trainer I ve realized that Pakistan is really deprived of providing professional development opportunities to the teachers. So I can better utilize my learning this way and cascade my knowledge to the maximum teachers so maximum students can get benefit from it.

Note: I also have US travel history once in 2019 in a fully funded program by Regional English Language Office of US embassy Islamabad.

VO: Ok so, you can take these documents back and we've approved your visa. (Passed me the blue slip while smiling)
Me: thank you. (Smiled back)
VO: Enjoy your stay with your family. (Said happily)
( For most of the time, she kept looking and typing at the screen. Didn't look at me for longer than a second or two during each of my answers. Also my answers were brief and to the point so she didn't have to look for long either.
I kept an eye contact during the whole interview and also maintained a bit smile throughout my interview though it went quite long and I had to wait a lot in between too.
I had a plus point of already having a visit visa so I used that in start while answering the question of why I chose that uni. As I heard that the VO may have not gone through all your data so you should convey them such info yourself.
Though my answers were not in detail but i did prepare myself for any type of detail. I made a list of all possible questions and prepared the detailed answers then filtered out the important information only.  Saved the detail for only the case if they themselves ask me to go into.
You should definitely have all the information about the university you're applying to. They should not get the idea that you've selected a university without doing any proper research)

Hello,
I am from Pakistan. I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s Masters program, and received a financial aid award that does not cover personal, food and travel expenses (along with other services and amenities). I wanted to write here to ask about alternative sources of funding (both International/American and Pakistani) that could help me finance my graduate study in the United States/at Bard and cover the remaining costs. I have spoken to their financial aid 
officer, but thought it might be worth a shot, to ask here and get your suggestions. 
Thank you very much.

VO: Wellcome to the state. Your passport will be delivered to you in 2 to 4 business days.
These questions are so simple but in a way its more difficult for those students who are feeling hesitation in front of visa officer.
So the thing all students have to do is Just be confident and look in the eyes of the visa officer. Don’t lie about anything, they already have your background data and talk to them what they ask in simple words. 
Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

Date: November 7, 2022
VISA Rejected 
VO 
was female and was rejecting most of the candidates and i am pretty sure she was annoyed with the behaviour of candidates she was rejecting. 
She requested the documents i.e, passport and F1 with out any greetings.
VO: why do you want to go to US
Me: To complete my master from sanit paul state university.
VO: Where is that ? 
Me: Minnesota
VO: How did you find it ? 
Me: A senior colleague who us working in my company has completed the same program and he referred it to me. 
VO: Have you applied to any other university?
Me: No, I only applied to this university.
VO: who is sponsoring you ?
Me: I am sponsoring myself, i have been working from more than 9 years and on side i also trade cars. These are some of my investments that I have liquidated for my education.
VO: Have you ever travelled before?
Me : Yes 
VO: which countries?
Me: Turkey and Malaysia.
VO: where do you work ?
ME: I am working in XYZ company.
VO: what is your position?
ME: I am working as a ____ Manager
VO: any of your family member have completed a degree from USA?
Me: Yes, my cousin has compelted the degree from California state university.
VO: I am sorry you are not eligible, and handed me the yellow letter.
She didn’t even ask me to show the financial documents or any other documents. I am not sure where did I do wrong. What should I do ? Should I apply for 2nd attempt right away or wait ? Also do i have to change anything in DS-160 ?

Few basic recommendations for US Visa interview, how to fill ds160 and mistakes to avoid.
 Make sure your DS160 replicates your i20. 
( i.e. If you are going for masters which is normally for 2 years and you are planning to complete it in 1.5 years then you still need to put the same program completion date, which is in your i20.)
( 
i.e. whatever program name is written on your i20, write the same in DS160 form as well. Like: if it is Marketing/Marketing Management/ General 52.4527.36 then write exactly the same in ds160 rather than just Marketing.)
 Make sure you fill the ds160 form by yourself and from one location. Even if you have hired consultant, fill it by yourself. Don’t give your consultant access of it. Just ask consultant for help if stuck on any question. Because at the end of ds160, there is a question that did you get help from anyone while filling this form? When consultant fills it for you and select No, and when Officer checks the ip address and it matches the consultanting firm location, it shows that you are lying, then they won’t believe a single word you utter(even though if it is true.) 
 If refused before then simply type in refusal box that you were refused for F1 visa under section 214b on xyz date, month, and year. That is it. No need to write stories. 
 If refused before, don’t change the college in 2nd attempt because it contradicts what you said about the college chosen in first attempt and shows you were not serious about it and you just chose that college because of consultant. If it was community college then it makes sense to change it because VO’s are tough with candidates who went with community college because it is easy to get into it. 
If asked, what have you changed in your profile? Never say nothing, I repeat Never. You have to say Yes and then it just depends upon case to case how you answer.
 When asked any question, don’t give one word answer. You also don’t need to exaggerate.
(I.e. if asked about sponsor and you father is your sponsor then your answer should be something like: My father will be my sponsor, he is a businessman and does a business of xyz and he is being doing that for xyz years. Don’t make them dig info out of you. If given opportunity tell them about it. I repeat, don’t exaggerate.
 Those who have shown off on their Daddy’s cash and uploaded something on social media that is violent like: holding a gun then delete it.
 There is no color concept when it comes to slip you get!
 Finally, luck does matter. (But not when you beg them to refuse you) 
Good Luck.

Hello everyone,
Location: Europe
Visa type: J-1
Decision: refusal 221g, reason administrative processing
I have applied for J-1 visa a month ago, and submitted everything that they ask, and what it is needed.
I have history of a J-1 visa and a B-1 approved visa already, so I was quite sure that I can’t be refused.
Plus I am studying in Eu having European PR.
So my mind is basically clueless why does it happened? The interviewer ask basic questions and give me the white paper along with my passport, marking the reason mentioned above.
When I asked him what to do, he explained that I am going to receive an email in couple of days, and I have to respond carefully.
After that, they will tell me the next steps if it is needed(approved).
I have some confusion, as I am panicking now, I have already did so much in my host university the paper work and everything and the project with the american university is decided and they are waiting for me to join from April.
If anyone has an idea what they will ask in the email? And how long it takes to receive of everything goes right?
MY previous experiences takes one week after interview to receive the passport, but this is unexpected for me so I will appereciate the response from the people who have the same experiences.
Thank you all!

VO: have you applied in any other universities 
Me: yes I have applied in 2 other universities 
VO: accepted or rejected
Me: I got accepted by both but I haven't paid the admission fee because MIU was my first priority and I got admission there. I would pay fee for next university incase if I was not able to make it to MIU. …

These questions are so simple but in a way its more difficult for those students who are feeling hesitation in front of visa officer.
So the thing all students have to do is Just be confident and look in the eyes of the visa officer. Don’t lie about anything, they already have your background data and talk to them what they ask in simple words. 
Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

Hi All,
I've recently accepted a Job offer in Boston and will be moving there by end of July/ Early August from Pakistan. My visa has also been approved. 
I'm looking to connect with students and other professionals that are looking for roommates / share accomodation and also any suggestions on where to live. 
Depending on the place, my budget is upto $2000/ Month, although I'd prefer it to be lower than that.
Thank you!

Salam Guys, today was my F1-Student Visa interview at Islamabad embassy and I got the visa, Alhamdulila. I am writing this post to share my experience and the whole interview process. This group is very helpful and I am grateful for all your help. 
Profile:
-First Attempt with no travel history
-Applied for MS Computer Science
-Had Assistantship from the university (shown in I-20 financial section as well)
-IELTS 7.5
-GRE 303
-BS cGPA 2.90/4
-I had bank statement of approximately 31,000 USD. I was only required to show ~13,000 USD as I had assistantship. My university corresponding person told me that its better to show total required amount even if you have assistantship/aid (though it was not required).
I did all by myself and no consultant was involved. I took a bundle of documents with me, though they checked only my I-20 and Bank statement but I will suggest you to bring as much documents of proof as you can (like property documents, earning proofs, degrees etc). I was the first one to be interviewed in the Non-Immigrant section even though my appointment was at 8am (there were 7am people too but I was first in the queue). The whole interview took approximately 2 minutes and then he gave me Blue paper (picture attached). I have heard that Green paper is for visa approval and blue paper is for visa approval and urgent passport delivery (my sister got blue paper and received her passport after 3 hours from embassy). 
Following are my Interview Questions+Answers:
1. Hello Sir, what is your purpose to visit USA?
Ans: I am going for my Master's degree.
2. Why you choose this school?
Ans: Because I am getting the scholarship here and also this university has one of the best CyberSecurity department.
3. What do you intend to do with this degree?
Ans: I am planning to start my own software company here in Pakistan. I think with my previous job experience and this degree, I will be sufficiently capable to handle a company.
4. Show me your bank statement. Who is your sponsor?
Ans: My father is my sponsor. (provided my bank statement, statement was of my own bank account even though my father was sponsor, he just looked at it for like 5 seconds).
5. What does your father do?
Ans: He is a government officer.
Then he said ""Gentleman, your visa is approved, you will get your passport in few days"" and handed me blue slip.

My visa interview experience.
Visa type: F1
Program: PhD in Chemistry (Fully funded)
University: Boston University
Status: Approved
June 
10, 2022 ,
US embassy, Islamabad
Travel History: 
US, as an exchange student
China, as a summer school student
 I wanted to share my interview experience for all those who are nervous about the interview, especially by seeing so many posts about visa rejection. Everyone's case is different.  Just be confident and sincere. 
So my interview was scheduled at 11 in the morning.  I reached at the shuttle service by 10 am. (On google map, it's, ""Visa Seeker Shuttle Service, for those who are not from Islamabad). 
 Went through the security and got the shuttle pass for Rs 2000. After about 5 minutes the shuttle came and took us to the embassy. Documents verification at the window (there were long lines and the process took about 15-20 minutes).
Then outside the interview hall, there were gain a long queue and entered the interview hall by 11:20, FINALLY!!!
Again documents verification, fingers scanning, and then you wait for your turn. Another 15-20 minutes. 
After the interview shuttle takes you back to the Shuttle Service area. There you can find taxis (if you need one) but they'll charge you almost double. So, if you want to save some money 
  public transport (vans) also pass by the area. 
VO: Hi, welcome. Pass me your documents.
Me: Hi. Passed her my documents.
VO: Put your left hand fingers on the scanner.
While I was scanning my fingers, 
VO: So you already have been to the US?
Me: Yes. I was there as an exchange student.
(She already started typing something)
VO:As an undergrad student?
Me: Yes.
VO: How long did you stay there?
Me: for one semester, that was about 5 months.
VO: Was it fully funded? 
Me: Yes. It was. Funded by the state department.
VO: Great. So this is a Fully-funded program right? (Looking at my I-20)
Me: Yes. It is. ( I wanted to mention that the university is also paying for the air tickets and the health insurance etc. But  she informally asked smiling (while typing) i'm just curious where were you placed when you last time in the uS?
Me: Told the University name.
She then asked about my experience, and did i like the place, people etc.that was kinda informal chat, i felt.
VO: Okay, so you'll be doing PhD in Chemistry, what type of Chemistry?
Me: I'll be working on  the development of plasmonic nanoparticles for water treatment.
VO: ok, water treatment? Great.
She typed another few secs and said, congratulations your visa is approved.
Me: thank you. 
Then I requested her for temperory withdrawal of my passport as I needed for another visa interview ( at German embassy)
She held my visa on pending till I return my passport.
The interview hardly lasted for 1 minute.
The waiting process was exhausting but worth it.
Best of luck

“SO HERE IF MY F1 VISA INTERVIEW JOURNEY”
            NO CONSULTANT INVOLVED

Me: Great. How about you?
VO: What changes you have made since your last application?
Me: Nothing. Because I want to go for this university!!
VO: Why you were rejected?
Me: I was nervous and didnt satisfy the officer. 
VO: Okay. So how you choose this university?
Me: Through US News. 
VO: Oh come on. US News has thousands of university. How you find this university?
Me: i searched HRM in search option. Found universities and saw this. 
VO: You are not getting my point. tell me how you filter this university. 
Me: I choose this university through course curriculum and I have talked to students as well. 
VO: so you have talked to the students as well. How and where?
Me: On LinkedIn and facebook group. 
VO: So what you have talked about?
Me: They told me the best thing about this university is that you can reach to professor directly rather than his assistants. 
VO: So my question is how you choose this university from thousands of university. If i write hrm in search of US News. Will it arrive among the thousand of university on Top?
ME: Yes it will arrive and this university more focued on analytical side rather theoretical which i was looking for. 
VO: So US News have filters options for cities and states as well? ( she laughed)

                  *SECOND ATTEMPT* 

4 January 2022. 

My Profile was completely same. Not a single thing was changed. 

VO: Hello. How are you doing?
Me: Great. How about you?

VO: What changes you have made since your last application?
Me: Nothing. Because I want to go for this university!!

VO: Why you were rejected?
Me: I was nervous and didnt satisfy the officer. 

VO: Okay. So how you choose this university?
Me: Through US News. 

VO: Oh come on. US News has thousands of university. How you find this university?
Me: i searched HRM in search option. Found universities and saw this. 

VO: You are not getting my point. tell me how you filter this university. 
Me: I choose this university through course curriculum and I have talked to students as well. 

VO: so you have talked to the students as well. How and where?
Me: On LinkedIn and facebook group. 

VO: So what you have talked about?
Me: They told me the best thing about this university is that you can reach to professor directly rather than his assistants. 

VO: So my question is how you choose this university from thousands of university. If i write hrm in search of US News. Will it arrive among the thousand of university on Top?
ME: Yes it will arrive and this university more focued on analytical side rather theoretical which i was looking for. 

VO: So US News have filters options for cities and states as well? ( she laughed) 
Me: Yes. (I laughed back)

Vo: Are you sure?
Me: Yes 100%

VO: Should I check it Right Now?
ME: Yes please. 

Vo:  “laughed” Let it be. 
Vo: So you will be doing MBA or Ms?
Me: I will be doing masters of science in human resource management. 

Vo: Why not Mba?
Me: Because mba is more focused toward theoretical side and Ms is more towards analytical side and I was looking for more technical learning. 

Vo: theory and analytics are all same. 
Me: No, you are wrong. Theoretical is more focused towards laws and you know…… (i forget) continued. Analytical is more focused towards tools and techniques. I will be learning tools like R, Python,HRIS. 

Vo: how many universities you have applied and name?
Me: 4 universities. University of texas at arlington. University of north texas. Dallas baptist and websters which is in Missouri. 

VO: Why you only focused on Texas?
ME: because texas is one if the most emerging state and it has similer climate as well which is in karachi. 

VO: Do you know the temperature Dallas had last night?
ME: Yes -2. 

VO: so how it is same as in Karachi?
Me: Yes it is somehow different and i want to experience that as well. Also texas and sindh both are deserted area hence same climate. 

VO: She laughed loud. 

VO: okay so who will pay this fees?
Me: my uncle?

VO: Who is your uncle? 
Me: my father’s sisters husband. 

VO: laughed. I dont want to know about your relation i want to know why he is sponsoring you?
