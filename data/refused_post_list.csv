Q1, 
What are the courses you’re going to study in first semester?
Ans, Cornerstone and two introductory courses. Fundamentals of management & marketing.
Q2, Why US?
Ans, After graduation last year, I joined the xyz industry and I noticed a commonality amongst CEOs of top 10 companies operating here which was that 7 out 10 CEOs have all studied from the USA. And since I also want to make my career in Pakistani xyz industry, having studied in the US would increase my odds of a successful career in Pakistan Significantly.
Q2, When did you graduate? 
Ans, Last year in 2022, in the months on June/July
Q3, What did you do after that?
Right after graduation I joined xyz organisation’s headquarters for an internship for a period of 3 months and while still there I landed a job at the headquarters of abc and I have been working here since then.

Q7, (Pointing towards to amount on I20) VO asked about how I’ll arrange the funds needed for the second year of my master’s as the amount written on i20 is only for 1st year.
Ans, I already have the funds needed for second year of my masters as can be seen from my bank statements. My family has liquid funds of double the amount needed in I20 allowing for any unforeseen circumstances.
Q8, Please show me your bank statements
Ans, Passed the statements to the VO
Kept looking on the screen and then said that the US visa laws are very strict I’m sorry and then gave me a white slip.

Visa Approved in the third attempt!
Sharing this experience as a hope for many of you guys who will be appearing in their third attempt. I was refused twice in May and June from Islamabad Consulate. I applied again with the same profile after deferring my admission in the Karachi Consulate. 
I was refused first time around for showing myself self sponsoring my education even though I wasn't doing any job and my father had given me the funds back then too. It was a blunder from 
my side in the first attempt. 
2nd time around, the interview lasted only a minute, before visa officer refused me without asking any major questions. It was quite tough to gather the confidence for applying again after such an interview. 
Interview on 26th October.
University of Houston.
Master's in Industrial Engineering.
Karachi Consulate. 
Visa officer was an American Male in his 40's. 
When I reached the counter, we greeted each other and after that there was a pause of around 2-3 minutes without Vo asking me anything as he was going through my profile. 
Vo: Tell me about your parents.
My mother is a housewife. My father is an industrialist, we have have a business of manufacturing of adhesives and lubricants which my grandfather started 50 years back and after him his sons are managing it now and also the reason why I want to do industrial engineering, as I have to comeback and manage it afterwards.
Vo: In how many uni's did you apply?
I applied to a total of 5 uni's, out of which I got accepted into 4 of them. I applied to Clemson University where I got rejected from, and I got acceptances from UIC, USF, FSU and UOH where I'm going. Among them I choose University of Houston because Houston is a big industrial city and UOH has strongly industrial affiliated faculty. There are couple of professors at UOH, who take their students for industrial visits every week as part of their curriculum which enhance their practical knowledge which I'm looking for. 
I was quite animated at this moment and was making some hand gestures which annoyed the Vo. He asked me to stop doing that and answer him as I was talking to a friend. 
Vo: So you have one brother who is handling your family business? (I don't know where he got this from)
I told him that I have two elders brothers and they are also handling the business and well.
Vo: Have your brothers also studied from aboard?
No. They have got their education in Pakistan. 
Vo: Why do they want to send you abroad?
Told the visa officer how many brothers always wanted me to get the exposure and how they have always encouraged me to pursue education from abroad. I did an Aiesec internship in 2019, mentioned that too.
After this the Vo stopped asking questions and tried to make a decision but he was undecided at this time. I asked him I could help him with anything else but he said that he is not sure either way right now. I asked him should I tell him about why choose Industrial Engineering in the first place. He said no and that I would have read the website and would just pour it all out on him. 
I said no, just let me explain why I wanted to do Industrial Engineering.
Told him about Industrial Engineering and how USA is the pioneer of this field and that only a couple of uni's in germany and canada are offering this course with the same curriculum. Also mentioned that I have acceptances from Canada and Australia as well but I choose USA because of their quality etc.
Vo: Did your Visa also got rejected from Canada and Australia?
No. I didn't apply for Visa there, as I wanted to study Industrial Eng and my courses were different there.
Vo was still undecided trying to make a decision.
Vo: How big is your industry.
Told him about the number of people working there.
Vo: Okay, tell me about your time at Turkey.
Told him about Aiesec and how this internship gave me exposure and boosted my confidence etc. 
Eventually, the Vo handed me the blue slip. 
Vo: Enjoy your time in the USA.

Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world.

vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.

This time, i have did everything on my own and i have received my i-20 and i want to take an Embassy appointment. I asked the consulatant can you just take an appointment for me, he is saying “I am Busy, i’ll do it when i have time”.  And he also isn’t giving me the credentials of the portal. 
Can you please let me know, for taking an embassy appointment, as i am in a refused 
category, do i need to use the same account of US Embassy portal by which my DS-160 was submitted earlier and i took my appointment?

VO: 
Hay Good Morning
Me: Good Morning
VO: Pass me your passport and I-20
Me: Sure Sir
VO: Put your right hand 4 finger on the scanner
Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

Me: Sir ,Is their anything wrong in my profile or what is the actual reason of refusal so that I can workout on it

Me: 3, UC Berkeley , Caltech and UT Austin.
VO: Ahn ,did you get admit from them ?
Me: UC Berkeley No ( because I was looking for fully funded offer ) ,UT Austin Yes with fully funded offer.
VO: Why Caltech ?
Me: There is number of reasons behind it 1) Pre-communication with my PhD supervisor, 2) Lab facilities in Caltech are advanced; 3) First university which are offering courses in 3D printing.
VO: why you look for 3D printing courses ?
Me: Because I'll be conducting my research with my supervisor on 3D print Concrete structures.

Me: Kind of , well sir actually I don't see any scope of 3DPC in my home country in next 20-25 years ,as this is highly advanced and emerging construction technology ,we still rely on traditional formwork construction, therefore , honestly speaking I'll be looking for a job in US or in Australia after having my PhD from Caltech in 3DPC .And...( VO asked ) .
VO: I see, this has to be an emerging and advance technology.You motivated me to study about it.chuckle..He called another guy on his back side and started discussing something while looking at my CV and I-20 .They were taking time ....
VO:Any travel history?
Me: Yes , Singapore, Japan , Turkey, UAE, Thailand and Malaysia etc.

Me: should I change my university for the 2nd attempt.
VO: it's not necessary, Caltech is best.
I was wondering and tried to get more Infos from there but couldn't succeed .
I still have the feelings that ties with country in this shouldn't be the case of visa  rejection.

READ THIS COMPLETELY IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO WASTE YOUR $$$ AND BE TRAPPED BY THESE SO-CALLED CONSULTANTS
All this started back in October 2022.
Firstly, I decided to go USA for my further studies as an undergraduate student, I chose my desired university but as I was blank and didn't know about this group I got trapped by one of the consultants in Karachi
OceanMall Those who live in Karachi know about it, There's a similar agency by the name of Ocean. I went there and discussed my university they told me they are associated with them but later on they got back to their word when I paid out their upfront fee and they forced me to their Panel Unversities
After paying out 40k PKR upfront they shared with me a document that says you need to pay a further 600$ to us for your process which indicates that 2/3 University application fee, SOP, Motivation letter, Internal evaluation of your documents US standards, and attestation from notary public
When I asked about my desired university all their excuse was that I was being so specific about it, and when I paid them and asked them to add one more university in place of my desired uni they acknowledged me we would do it
So, when I 1st paid them 300$ half of the 600$ which was equivalent to 67k PKR back on that date they provided me a single admission letter by the end of Dec 2022, and when I inquired about my money where they spent they refused to keep the transparency with me about anything and further added that when we get the admission letter our job is done, we don't apply to more university until we need. 
when I told them I needed the admission letter from the remaining uni as well I was told this would take 1 or 2 months which I answered I had no issues with that I needed it yet after 1 month they asked me to send my English test to uni that's where I got to know all that time they have not done anything and when I inquired about the last one which they answered ""we are not getting replies by that uni"" when I was personally in touch with that uni I was shocked and utterly disappointed to see that lying wasn't a big deal for them
That's where I wasted my 5 months because of them
Secondly, When I was doing everything on my own I got an acceptance letter and I20 from the university but then again I got trapped by another consultant this time got to learn about that agents who work with different recruiters, and all directly don't apply directly but by through the channels
I got the offer letter from Texas A&M Corpus Christi and the agency asked me to pay the Initial enrollment fee which was $ 1,000 I paid that fee in May 2023 and now I'm chasing them to get my refund back
When I paid out the enrollment fee I was just waiting for the I20, but guess what I have been offered an admission letter but my documents were not submitted still to the university that is again I got to know by the University itself after 2.5 months and the intake also missed out
So now altogether my 4 Lac 6k PKR is stucked with these consultants
Right now at the start of October, I tried to trust another person who was vouched by my friend to take my case and started working on but the person has disappeared now for no reason this time I have not paid anything to that person but, my time YES
My main reason for sharing this experience with you all is that do your research and apply on your own these consultants and recruiters will just gonna waste your time and nothing else
They know how to trap the students by showing scholarship ads and all but in the end they will offer you the same thing which you can find on the university website
This group has everything that a student needs!!!!

Me: I don't know. Maybe i loose my confidence or due to bad circumstances.
VO: But you had to clearify from the last Visa officer that why she's refusing your Visa?
.......I was really confused at this question and didn't know what to answer.......
Than I simply replied that you (V officers) don't tell the actual reason to the candidates.
She started typing on computer and i still had a Hope that I've given my best full confidently so after typing she just gonna approve my Visa but when she put yellow slip in front of me than I was really shocked.

Date: 14th October 
Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Good afternoon everybody!
I was refused in April 2023 (F1 Visa).
Now I have changed my university and would like to appear for the interview again.
Unfortunately, I am not able to secure the date before 21st August 2023.
I 
booked the appointment in 1st week of September, I then talked to my university's International department in this regard and they were more than happy to provide me late arrival approval letter in case of attending the orientation and classes online on the zoom.
I consented and they provided me the late arrival approval letter of 1 month (20/09/2023).
Now I want to know if I could not secure the early dates, would I be able to satisfy my Consular officer with that letter?
Anyone with the same experience got their visa approved?
Please step forward and help me in this regard, I would be more than grateful to get assisted.
Thanks and Jazak Allah.

Visa refused (weak ties to home country)
Responses:
Why this university 
There are a couple of reasons for choosing this uni, it is offering me modules like international political economy that no other college in my list offered which directly aligns with my future plans. 
Other than that its location was a major attraction for me, as depaul is in center of Chicago, chicago is very diversified hence I can gain alot of cultural exposure which will further bolster my education.
Lastly, it gave me a generous amount of scholarship
Who is sponsoring you?
My father, what does he do(told)
How many employees in his company?
25-30 
What other schools did you apply to?
I applied top liberal arts schools in uk&usa.
Why did you choose this uni over them?
It had a better sub courses, and offered me more scholarship. 
Can anyone tell me where did I go wrong?

My J1 visa was refused few days ago. VO asked me to explain source of funding of my salary. I told him that university offered me research position that is mentioned on the invitation letter. He was insisting that I must have to tell him that where university got funding to give me salary. He said your visa is refused and asked me to send him documents for further administration procedure. He said we will send you email then you can send us your passport by post later.
Anyone 
knows how long this procedure usually take? Thanks

Hi everyone 
On 4th April my f1 visa was refused in US embassy but now I got another appointment for 3rd August 
I need help in one of my question for interview. 
I have applied at Illinois State University for nutrition psychology 
Need help to upgrade and arrange my answer of this question.
Q- 
Why USA? 
A- 
 Well, as everyone knows US ranks at no . 1 for having best education system and new research methods.Illinois State University is also providing American certified degrees which will help me to establish my career here more successful as there are not many experts in this field in my country and we need them.. According to Education Quality and Technology, America is far better than any other country because Germany is also offering research based studies and my field is all about research and survey based in which I’m interested but because of language barrier I can not express  myself there but in US it will be easier for me to communicate and learn.I also had a choice for UK but in UK There’s no multicultural environment.
