Visa refused (weak ties to home country)
Responses:
Why this university 
There are a couple of reasons for choosing this uni, it is offering me modules like international political economy that no other college in my list offered which directly aligns with my future plans. 
Other than that its location was a major attraction for me, as depaul is in center of Chicago, chicago is very diversified hence I can gain alot of cultural exposure which will further bolster my education.
Lastly, it gave me a generous amount of scholarship
Who is sponsoring you?
My father, what does he do(told)
How many employees in his company?
25-30 
What other schools did you apply to?
I applied top liberal arts schools in uk&usa.
Why did you choose this uni over them?
It had a better sub courses, and offered me more scholarship. 
Can anyone tell me where did I go wrong?

Me: I will graduate by May 15, 2023.
VO: So how did you apply at Purdue University ?Did not understand the question at first , and asked, are you talking about hobbies? VO repeat the question.
Me : ( was not expecting this question) Every year PhD position are announced and I apply through it. ( VO starts typing on the computer, after some time I told her , I write SOP for my program explaining my current research and what I will be doing in futur ).
VO: Is there was any interview before selection?

Status refused 6th March
My interview lasted for 10 minutes atleast everything was going in order. I dont know what is the reason of my  refusal. Experts please tell me what should i do now.
Me. Good morning
Vo. No reply. Give me your i20 and passport
Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world. Degree obtained from usa has much more worth then any of other countries here in pakistan. They also offer practicle courses, flexible education and cultural diversity further enhanced the educational experience. 
Vo. what are you going to study
Me. I going to peruse masters of cyber security.
vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.
Vo. Sory, we can not approve your visa this time and gave me slip.
Experts please tell me where did I go wrong.

VO: Pass me your documents

Me: He's a businessman and he owns a unit of departmental stores with the four branches. Two of them are in Sialkot Cantonment while the other Two are in Gujranwala Cantonment.But the main branch is in Gujranwala cantt and that's also on Google.
VO: Why your Visa was refused last time?
Me: I don't know. Maybe i loose my confidence or due to bad circumstances.
VO: But you had to clearify from the last Visa officer that why she's refusing your Visa?
.......I was really confused at this question and didn't know what to answer.......
Than I simply replied that you (V officers) don't tell the actual reason to the candidates.
She started typing on computer and i still had a Hope that I've given my best full confidently so after typing she just gonna approve my Visa but when she put yellow slip in front of me than I was really shocked.
...So please must give me any advice that should I apply again or what to do know?

Embassy: Karachi
Refused on first interview (9th December) 
Master of science in computer Science from University of the pacific. 
In my first attempt, they asked me only four questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I applied again a 4 days after my first attempt. 
ME: Good morning Officer,
VO: Good Morning, 
VO: Why you are going to the USA? 
ME: Officer I am going to pursue my master's in Computer Science.
VO: okay so why going to study there?
Me: USA has the highest Academic standard, also they have more hands on practice learning. Apart from this graduating from a USA university can lead me to the senior level job in pakistan.  
VO: Ahaan, So where are you currently working?
Me: I am working as a ******* Engineer at (Company name) 
VO: Sorry as a? 
ME: Told my position, and company name again. 
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Told detailed of skills i worked.
VO: How did you applied for this university?
ME: Officer, I applied for total four universities, and I applied through websites. 
VO: Which universities you applied to?
ME: Told all four universities name.
VO: Where is ******** university?
ME: told the city name, after saying it I smiled and said officer at this time even I don’t remember the exact location but it's situated in this city. 
VO: Smiles and said Even i have also heard the university name first time 
So, where is university of the pacific i haven’t heard that as well. 
ME: Officer, it's in Stockton, California even though they have their three campuses and told the other cities name. And i am going to Stockton campus.
VO: Ohh, okay. 
VO: Your fees is quite expensive, who is going to pay it. 
ME: My father is sponsoring me, as he is a Consultant Doctor.

ME: I said No mam, we are not affected so much then other these areas (stated other cities name)
VO: Okay. 
Then asked me about my brothers and what they do. Also Asked anyone relative in the USA.
After few minutes typing on computer officer gave me pink slip that your visa is approved. 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that it's very hard to get cleared in second attempt but never loose hope and stay calm. 
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!
"
13,"
Hi guys, My visa was refused on 31 Jan the worst day of my life. I was not expecting that I was sure that I am a genuine student and that my profile is so strong my visa will not be refused but it is. I went into depression and couldn't even talk to my parents for a few days then I decided I am not gonna try again. I should switch to Australia and apply there. And I was scared that maybe my Australian visa will be refused because my USA visa is refused. I contacted many 
consultants they said It's not a big deal. I asked a few questions in this group and came to know that it's not a big deal many students got visas on the second attempt. So I gathered information from everyone and came to the point I should try again for the USA. because if my Australian visa is refused there will be no chance that my USA visa will be approved. So I defer my semester to fall 2023. So I want to know from you guys What I should change to my application?
Should I change university? All other students who applied to that uni got visa approval, not even a single one got a refusal.
Should I add another sponsor along with my father?
Those guys who got approval after rejection please tell me what you guys did.
Lastly, I want to tell you to say your interview did not go well which may be the reason. But my interview lasted for 15 minutes and I answered everything. But when I posted my experience in this group I realized that I made 1 to 2 mistakes but that's not a reason for refusal.

Hello everyone
One of my friend and me appeared in islamabad consulate on 14 April with regular appointment instead of previously refused.No one questioned us on this and we saw no.of students with regular but i have seen a post in this group a student got refused by karachi consulate because of using regular appointment.
I don’t think officer have any problem with your appointment category and give refusal on the basis of appointment category because they don’t know about this 
and they never asked for appointment confirmation slip on interview counter.
Anyone here who used regular appointment in karachi consulate without any problem instead of previously refused?

VO: Put your right hand 4 finger on the scanner
Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

3rd Interview for F-1 
Status: Refused 
When 
I reached to visa officer, she scanned my passport and said Oh! You applied twice in December 2022? 
Me: Yes, 
VO: okay, what did you change in your profile/application? 
Me: I changed my way of confidence and i am prepared this time for Interview. In my last 2 visa interviews I was not much confident and did not deliver the satisfactory answers and spoiled the whole interview session. 
VO: what universities did you applied and why you applied only in those universities and why you chose this university. Me: told the universities names where I applied, and told her When I was searching on internet the best university in the US for MS Marketing with concentration of Data mining USF was on the top of the list then I researched more about the university and found out it is alligned with what I was looking for!! 
VO: why this course? Me: allow me few minutes elaborate my whole situation, as you can see in my DS160 my previous education is engineering, when I joined the company where I am currently employed I got a chance to work with their marketing and I found my hidden skills of marketing. After working and more with the marketing team my interest in this field increased but I observed myself there are still some gaps which needs to be filled and this course will help me to fill those gaps. During the session the VO was countinuously reading what was written on her computer screen instead of typing, I think she was reading notes dropped by previous visa officers on my application. 
VO: sorry, you can not qualify for US visa because you did not change anything in your profile/application.
Me: what do I need to change? 
VO: you have to change your application
Me: Okay, thanks. I left the counter.

MS in mathematics from NUST I was admitted to Ph.D. mathematics at a fully funded scholarship at RPI.
Interview experience.
VO: Good morning pass me your i-20 and passport.
Me. 
Good morning. yes sure
VO. Why do you want to get higher studies?

I got a silver medal in MSc and also did my MS from a top-ranked university in Pakistan. And now I want to be a professor after getting Ph.D.
VO. What are you doing since your last degree? (I didn't understand what he said and didn't ask VO to repeat the question).
Me. (I didn't remember what I answered.)
VO. What are you doing now?
Me. I have been teaching in a higher secondary school since April 2019.
VO. Have you visited the US before?
Me. No, I haven't.
VO. Why you are not doing PhD in Pakistan?
Me. I completed my master's from NUST Islamabad which is a top-ranked university in Pakistan. So I don't have a better option after getting MS from NUST. I have received offers from different countries but all of those offers were without funding. During this time I got an opportunity to study in the US with funding, and I accepted this offer.
VO. I can not issue a visa this time. Thank you.
During the interview, VO looks at my i-20 almost 4 times.
(I prepared my interview well. But didn't answer a single question I prepared. I don't know what happened at that time.)

Hello guys! Need help to decide this. My previous 2 visas were refused for Purdue University MSBA at Islamabad Embassy. From interviews, I gathered that my financials were the apparent reason for refusal since I have a student loan. 
I am working on showing complete balance in the bank statement for third attempt. I have an I-20 from Southern Methodist University MSBA with a good amount of scholarship. 
1. 
Should I change my university in the next attempt and would it be a problem since SMU is a downgrade from Purdue? 
2. Would it help at all if I choose Karachi for the next interview?

VO: why are u going to the US?
Me: For my bachelors in information systems
VO: why did u choose UTA
Me: It has an outstanding information systems program, and they offered me a really good scholarship which means they value me
VO: What makes UTA a good fit for u?

Is there anyone who got a rejection after Administrative Processing (221g)? Will they notify by email that your visa is rejected?
I have given interview in Karachi Consulate on April 28, 2022 and since then status was ""Refused"" and the date stated of last update was April 28, 2022 but today I checked again and it still says ""Refused"" but date of last updated changed to July 14, 2022. I got no email.
So I am confused that my visa is still under administrative processing or is it refused.

My university in previous attempts was SIUE (with 8K/year) scholarship. I’ve been accepted in Purdue Northwest (without scholarship) too, should I go with SIUE  or change it to Purdue?
-> 
My uncle were my sponsor in previous attempts. Now my principal sponsor is my father. (Circumstances changed)
Please guide what should I do as I’m a genuine student with a good profile but still they are refusing me. Should I only go with changed sponsor or should I change university too?
