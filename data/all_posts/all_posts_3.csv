Alhamdulilah! I 
got accepted to Fully Funded Masters 
Scholarship in Computer Science from 
Canada
 as well as 
America
.
HOW YOU CAN GET IT AS WELL?
1 line answer is: "" Good and Novel Research Work "" (Publication is not required).
A bit of 
detailed method
 (How I got the scholarship):
I have 
3.3 CGPA, and NO Publications
 but my research work is meaningful that I could write about it thoroughly in my Statement of Purpose.
Conduct good and meaningful research work in your home country (it means come with a problem and spend a few months or a year in solving that problem or problems in a good university or research lab under other professors, who can guide you).
Apply in Masters Thesis Programs only.
Write Statement of Purpose which should mainly focus on your research work and future prospects and reflects why this particular professor and university is the best match with your work (relate your work with prospective supervisor in the SOP, write his research paper titles and relate it with yours in 1-2 lines).
Get 3 Letters of Recommendations from your university (these letters should support and highlight your research work and what you have written in your SOP, it should not be generic at all (as most university professors give generic letters and they are useless).
Now, Choose universities you intend to apply based on your CGPA (like if you have just 3.0, then University of Toronto's scholarship doesn't make sense in your case) and follow these steps.
Visit Faculty profiles (related to your desired department of study), of let's say 20 different universities.
See the Google scholar and Personal Website of the Professors of that department you want to apply in. 
List down which 3 professors best matches with your research work and domain in those universities.
If there is no professor which matches with your research work, then do not apply in that university.
Write about his work and relate that to your work in your SOP.
Write him an email as well (after applying) that how his work was related and how you can assist him in his work and how his work fascinates you.
It would need you to read Abstracts of his recent research papers (to write, and relate such things in SOP)
Weightage to this method is 50% and 
rest of the 50%
 is Praying to Allah
Now Wait and be good to others. 
GREAT THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES AND HELP OTHERS.

Update: 
My F1 visa got accepted today. The VO didn’t ask me for any documents or bank statements. 
Hey!
my appointment is on 6th September and this will be 2nd interview at Islamabad embassy (got a refusal in July). The situation was different in my first attempt as I only had a scholarship of 25% and the rest of the amount was a loan from prodigy. 
Now 
in my second attempt I have almost 60% scholarship from the university and instead of loan from prodigy, my uncles are my sponsors (my mamu and khaalu) and my I20 only mentions a 12000$ family funding. 
I was refused under 214 (b) and the VO also showed a concern about my loan repayment. 
What do you think are the chances that I can secure an F1 visa in my second attempt with all the changes in my interview? 
P.S. I already have a valid B1/B2 visa which will expire in 2027.
Thank you

I recently accepted for fully funded PhD position.
On 17 April, I will receive my I20 form. The joining date to university is 1st June 2023.
Is it recommended to ask a supervisor to contact the US embassy to support my study visa application? So that application process will be faster.
Kindly guide me. Your help will be appreciated.

My F-1 visa got accepted today at Islamabad consulate, Alhamdulillah. VO just asked me the reason for going to USA and what would I do with my PhD degree in future.
However, my husband's (F-2) visa got into administrative processing due to his field in TAL and his current job. He clearly explained to the VO that he wouldn't be working in the states as he is not allowed to do so. VO returned his passport with 221g and said that there's nothing to be worried about, he just needs 
to upload his resume and publications list.
Has anyone faced a similar situation? If yes, how much time did it take for F-2 processing if F-1 was already approved?
"
"
I have a question? 
I have been accepted to one community college and 2 universities.
I have a study gap of almost 6 years but all of it is justified. 
One 
of the universities did ask and asked for my resume as I was working for the past 6 years.
I have my interview in the last of october. 
Any tips?

Greetings! 
A quick question.
I have been accepted to two universities. 
Ohio State University that costs around 50k a year
                                 Or
Indiana University Bloomington that costs 34k a year after 50% scholarship. 
Which one is better for getting the visa?
Jazak Allah

I got accepted in University of New Haven for MS mechanical Engineering 2022 Fall.
The university has emailed me the acceptance letter only. They said that in 7-9 days, I’ll be informed whether I got the scholarship or not.
They asked me for the Financial documents like band statement and affidavit to proceed with my I-20.
My 
question to this group is that:
What will be the process after I get my I-20?
I have zero idea about it.
Please guide.

Hello, 
I'm in urgent need of guidance. 
AlhamdulliAllah, I have been accepted to Carneige Mellon University for a Masters in Public policy and Management with a 40% tuition scholarship. But I'm still concerned about paying for the reminder of my tuition. I come for a middle-class family and my parents cannot afford it due to the volatile USD/PKR exchange rate. 
Can someone please guide on what should I do? or help me find any external funding? 
Is 
it a wise to opt for a student role?
I'll appreciate your response!

Please Admin approve my post.
AOA to all of you.
I've been accepted by a professor for PhD program at the University of California, USA. I need your feedback on an important matter. The guidelines state that if you've studied in an English medium, you don't need an English test like IELTS or TOEFL. I reached out to the professor, who advised me to ask the graduate admission director, but I haven't received a response. I then contacted the graduate student affairs officer, who 
confirmed that I don't need to take the IELTS.
I'm a bit concerned about whether I should proceed without the test. The application deadline is December 1st, and need a 7-band score. Will this decision impact my application negatively? Your insights are much appreciated.

I've been accepted into the University of South Dakota's MS program and previously applied for an F1 visa in February 2024. Unfortunately, my application was rejected. I've since made several adjustments for my 2nd attempt:
-I haven't listed my Master's degree. (That i already persued) As double masters is red flag.
-I've reduced my work experience.
-I've tailored my job descriptions for the program.
-I've included my current job details.(Which i wont during my first attempt)
I'm unsure whether to hide my Master's degree in this application. Any advice or other suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.

Hello,
I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s graduate program (in NYC), with a financial aid award that covers tuition, Bard-sponsored housing/accommodation, and health insurance. However, expenses related to travel and food will not be waived and I’d be entirely responsible for managing them. Moreover, the program does not have any on-campus jobs/employment (I’m not allowed to live/work off-campus) and I would quite literally be on my own. I wanted to write here 
to ask for advice: Should I say yes to this offer? Is it possible to be a bit too frugal in New York and save money/stop myself from needless spending? Would I be able to manage? How can I bring down the remaining costs that have not been covered by my financial aid award? Any sort of assistance/piece of advice is welcomed.
Thank you very much.

Hello.
I have been emailing professors for positions in their respective PhD programs since April but have not gotten a positive response from anywhere. Then, a few days back, my application for a PhD program in one of the universities got accepted. Now they're asking me to upload my documents etc. How is it possible that none of the professors accepted me but I still got in? What do I do about the funding? I called the uni and they said all TA positions are taken. Everywhere 
on this group and the PhD holders from USA around me are saying that PhD is always fully funded. What am I supposed to do? I'm still emailing the professors that haven't responded from that uni.

Asslamualikum, members.
A dumb question:
Should the physical photograph submitted to the consulate on the interview day match the picture uploaded for your DS-160?
The 
picture uploaded for my DS-160 was snapped professionally with a mobile against a white wall in my home and was successfully accepted. So, should I get this picture printed from a picture studio, or can I get a new one snapped in a different attire?
Thank you!

I applied for Master in Data Science program in these universities and my application has also accepted from all of these universities,
1 = Illinois institute of technology, Chicago
2 = American university Washington dc
3 = Florida Atlantic university
4 = University of the Pacific california
Now 
I am confused as to which University should I select for this program. Because I wanted to select the university out of these which has the best learning environment and the best scope related to jobs in the future. If anyone has any knowledge of which university has the best scope for data science out of these four universities, kindly please let me know, so that I can start all further procedures related to my visa as soon as possible.

Hello,
I am from Pakistan. I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s Masters program, and received a financial aid award that does not cover personal, food and travel expenses (along with other services and amenities). I wanted to write here to ask about alternative sources of funding (both International/American and Pakistani) that could help me finance my graduate study in the United States/at Bard and cover the remaining costs. I have spoken to their financial aid 
officer, but thought it might be worth a shot, to ask here and get your suggestions. 
Thank you very much.

Hi, I recently got accepted at a school in chicago for a psychology program(Masters) 
I had a couple questions, if anyone of you can help me out a little.
1- My current school is around 13k per semester; however i dont want to start studying here. Im just planning to use their i20 to get visa. Since they have a low acceptance rate, im assuming it’ll be helpful in getting the visa through them. 
Is 
it possible that i transfer to a community college before even starting my semester at my original school? 
(If yes, are there any you guys can suggest?)
2- Should i apply to these community colleges from pakistan( right now) or when i come ? (Given that i do get my visa approved) 
3- Can you give me a step to step guide as to how i will be able to transfer right away ? If anyone has been through the process, id love to hear your experience. 
(The community colleges i checked have a deadline of august 15th for fall 2023) 
4- Can i work off campus on my very first month of coming to the states or am i only allowed to work on campus( given that i will not have a SSN initially) 
Any other piece of advice you can give me, id love to hear it. Please help a sis out 
 
Thanks!

Hello,
I have done MBA in marketing 2020 and now I am willing to pursue my Ms in Business analytics from US.  Visa officer could most probably ask me  about why double masters. I need suggestions regarding this question since my interest area is business analytics and wanted to enhance my skills and expertise in this field but I don't understand how to logically answer this question.
Furthermore, I want to know how higher the chances are of visa approval for the candidates of 
double masters.
Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated.

Also the courses here at UMN are those that i am already familiar with but still need to gain technical expertise in. Like food analysis and food safety. And i have heard minneapolis is a beautiful city.
VO: ok ok and who is funding you?
Me: HEC
VO: I see that its partly funded by your university.
Me: Yes partly funded by university and rest by HEC so its completely funded.
VO: okay great. Congratulations. Enjoy your stay. Read the rules…… (couldn’t hear anything further as i was already crying almost)
I took the blue slip, my documents and almost ran out of the hall (as if he would catch me and give my passport back 
)
I was confident, i made sure that my answes are related to my research and reflect me and not any general answer. This is the key i think. Thank You everyone for all the support that I got.

Dear Group Members,
One of the professors from University of Florida has accepted me to enroll in a PhD project under her supervision. The project is fully funded. Also, she has offered me to work as a teaching assistant at the department as well. 
Currently, I am clueless about the next steps (e.g., Visa processing and documentation). I would really appreciate if you all could guide me on the following points:
1) 
What type of visa options are available in my case? I am married and would take my spouse with me.
2) Besides degrees, passport and acceptance letter, what other documents would be needed?
3) How long does the whole process take?

Hello and Eid Mubarak!
I'm planning to go for my post-grad studies this Fall-23 and have been accepted by the University of San Francisco in their Energy Systems Program. The University has offered me a $10k scholarship for the whole academic year, and the rest will be funded through student loan (cos I don't want to use my PKR savings to fund my studies). 
Total per annum expenses are (incl. living, and other expenses) $50k. (I will be showing proof of funds of around 30k; 20k 
savings account and 10k scholarship)
My questions from the community are:
1) would there be any issue in the F1 visa processing? 
2) Do i need to show complete Proof of Funds of $50k? Or should i tell them that part of the cost will be funded through student loan?
3) I'm funding my education from my own savings. My family won't be supporting me (coz they don't have that much money or source of income). I have 6 years of professional working experience. 
Your help is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Hello everyone.
I would really appreciate your valuable suggestions on my current situation. I have been accepted into the University of South Carolina, Columbia, and had a visa interview scheduled for March 10th. Fortunately, the interview went well, but I was informed that my visa application was refused under section 221g. The Visa Officer has requested additional documents, including a detailed study/research plan and its practical application. (Attached)
I have already 
contacted my potential supervisor, and he has agreed to provide a letter stating that I will be working with him in his research group. The graduate director will be providing this letter in the upcoming week. However, it has already been three days since my visa interview, and I am concerned that submitting the documents late could cause issues.
I would greatly appreciate any guidance or advice on this matter from those who have more experience in this area.
 Thank you!

Hi everyone.
I got offered to join Masters in Data Science at the University of Connecticut, Storrs, for Fall 2023. I just accepted the offer and paid the enrolment fees. I've been instructed to submit an official transcript and degree diploma/certificate.
As I still need to get my degree and transcript attested by the Higher Education Commission, I fear the documents still count as official and will be accepted.
Further, if anyone is currently enrolled or aiming to join the 
University of Connecticut, please connect to help me with the process as I proceed.
Thanks.

Hi everybody!!!
Today, I received my degree’s evaluation from World Education Services(WES). I am gonna share my experience with you. 
Most of the USA’s universities requires you to submit a copy of your foreign education evaluation through WES. 
They will ask you for this report during process of your admission application. 
Timeline:
Business Day 1: WES received the Documents. 
Business Day 3: All received documents are correct & no additional documents are required. Started working on report/evaluation. 
Business Day 6: Report is ready and dispatched to mention address/university. 
Required Documents:
I sent them 10th, 12th, and 16th grade verified result cards and degrees in sealed envelope. 
Cost: 
It cost me $228 basic. $32 + shipping for each university.  
I got equivalency of USA 4 years bachelor’s degree. My CGPA didn’t change at all.

Hello everyone! 
I would really appreciate your advice on a few matters. 
Firstly, my husband has been accepted into Harvard Law School for his Master's degree, with an 85% scholarship and the rest is the loan offered from the harvard law school. I wanted to inquire whether I need to apply for an F2 visa right now, considering I already hold a visit visa valid for 5 years. I don't intend to stay with him throughout his 9-month Master's program. However, I want to ensure that it 
will be easy for me to convert my visa once he secures employment. Or will there be issues since I didn't convert it immediately?
Furthermore, I wanted to ask if we can book an appointment for an F2 visa before receiving the I-20 form. Additionally, what are the wait times for this process? I'll be in Islamabad, so we will be scheduling the appointment there. 
Please inform me of the estimated duration of this process. Thank you.

Me: Hello officer, I hope you are doing well.
VO: Hello. Pass me your documents.
Me: Sure officer. (passed passport, I20, DS160 confirmation, SEVIS confirmation)
VO: Okay, so why are you going to the U.S.
Me: Officer, I am going to the U.S. to pursue my MS at Carnegie Mellon University.
VO: Carnegie Mellon University (impressed). And what degree?
Me: Robotics
VO: Okay (became serious after hearing robotics, and started typing on his computer).
VO: And what was your undergraduate degree in?
Me: Electronics Engineering
VO: What other schools did you apply to?
Me: Officer, apart from CMU I applied to the University of Pennsylvania, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, New York University, Boston University, Arizona State University, University of Maryland College Park, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, University of California San Diego, and Northwestern University.
VO: (Paused typing and looked at me) And how many of these did you get admitted to?
Me: I got admitted to all of these except Northwestern University, for which I am waitlisted currently. 
VO: (impressed upon hearing my admits) Do you have your resume with you today?
Me: Yes officer, I do. (passed my resume to him)
VO: (glanced over my resume, and then continued typing something on his computer).
VO: When is your program starting?
Me: 14th August 2023
VO: And what are you exactly is taught in the program?
Me: (Explained the course structure and overall work I will be doing).
VO: Do you have a course plan with you? Or what courses you will exactly study?
Me: (Shared individual courses including core courses and elective courses I plan on studying during my time).
VO: (Didn't respond, typing something on his computer)
VO: Okay, and who is going to fund you? (looking at my I20)
Me: (told)
VO: Do you have your proof of funds with you?
Me: Yes officer, (passed the documents).
VO: (glanced over my financial documents, then placed it to his side, and continued typing. Then got up from his seat with my documents and went to the back and fetched a white paper which was the administrative processing document)
VO: Okay, so what do your father and sister do (sponsors)?
Me: My father is a neurologist over here in Karachi, and my sister is a general surgeon in the UK.
VO: So, why are you going to study after all these years? (I graduated back in 2018)
Me: Well officer, the field that I am currently in, i.e. Computer Vision and Robotics are evolving at such a fast pace that its nearly impossible to keep up with the state of the art. And given that I have been out of school for the past 4.5 years, I think its high time that I go back to school and brush up on a couple of fundamentals and update my skillset.
VO: Okay. (Picked up my resume and started going through it).
VO: So are you on a H1B visa currently? (my current employer is based out of Redmond, Washington)
Me: No officer, I work remotely as a foreign contractor under the title of Lead Research Engineer.
VO: Okay so you work on Machine Learning at Retrocausal? (mentioned on my resume)
Me: Yes officer, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. We basically design vision systems for our customers like Ford, Honda, NASA, PACCAR, Apple, etc.
VO:  (started typing on his computer. After a while returned my CV and Return offer letter from Retrocausal, continued typing, and then returned my financial documents as well)
VO: Okay. And what is this NED on your resume?
Me: Officer that's the name of my undergraduate school.
VO: and is it over here in Karachi?
Me: Yes officer.
VO: What universities did you get admitted to? (he asked this question again, in my opinion, he wanted to cross-check whether I was BS'ing about my admits which obviously I wasn't)
Me: Officer, like I mentioned earlier, apart from Carnegie Mellon University, I got admits from University of Pennsylvania, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, New York University, Boston University, Arizona State University, University of Maryland College Park, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and University of California San Diego. And currently, I am waitlisted by Northwestern University.
VO: (continued typing for the next 30 seconds)
VO: Okay so, further documents are required for your case so I cannot approve your visa just yet. I am returning your passport and a list of documents that I have marked. You will have to upload these on the portal, the link of which is mentioned on the form. If your visa is approved we will email you on how to submit your passport.
Me: (taking my passport and the 221(g) administrative document) Okay sure officer, thank you for your time.
My personal takeaway:
a) Be honest. As I stood in the line after my biometrics I overheard a couple of ongoing visa interviews. It was clear that they weren't being honest and aboveboard with the VO, and the outcome was that they got rejected.
b) Be confident. I know a lot of people have this latent tendency of being anxious when speaking English, that too in such a formal setting at the US consulate where the stakes are high, but this is something that could very easily be mitigated by having your story straight (The what, how, why, and where).
Best of luck to all the others in AP and all those prepping for their interviews. God Speed!

Hello dear students!
If you're a Pakistani student dreaming of studying in the USA, I urge you to reconsider choosing 
New York City (NYC)
 as your destination. While NYC is glamorously portrayed in movies, it's important to see the full picture before making a decision.
Here are a few reasons why NYC may 
not be the best choice
 for Pakistani international students:
Financial burden: 
NYC is one of the most expensive cities in the world, both in terms of tuition and living expenses. International students pursuing MS in NYC can expect to pay between $15,000 and $45,000 per year in tuition alone. Living expenses can add another $1,000 to $3,000 per month.
Limited Graduate Assistantships (GAs) and On-Campus Opportunities: 
NYC is highly competitive, and many international students face challenges in securing graduate assistantships or on-campus job opportunities. With a large pool of students and limited positions, it can be challenging to find these opportunities to help cover your expenses and gain valuable experience.
It's essential to explore other states in the USA that offer has higher likelihood of on-campus job opportunities.
Part-time job struggles: 
Many Pakistani students in NYC work part-time to help cover their expenses. However, these jobs are illegal and often low-paying and have limited hours. Additionally, some employers may exploit or mistreat international students.
Housing woes: 
Finding affordable and decent housing in NYC can be a challenge, especially for women. Crowded apartments and subpar living conditions can become a health concern.
Mental health and well-being: 
The fast-paced and competitive environment in NYC can take a toll on students' mental health. 
There are many other states in the USA that can provide a quality education without the challenges that NYC presents. Consider states like 
New Mexico
, 
Oklahoma 
where tuition fees are lower, living expenses are more affordable, and there are more on-campus job opportunities.
I encourage you to make an informed decision about your study destination. Weigh the pros and cons carefully, and don't be afraid to ask for help from your family, friends, and advisors.
Additionally, I encourage students who are currently studying in 
NYC to share their experiences and thoughts
. Your insights can be incredibly helpful for upcoming students, providing them with a better understanding of what to expect and how to navigate the challenges and opportunities that NYC offers.

Hello everyone, 
Im in a bit tough situation. I got accepted into my top choice which is Columbia university NY. But i didnot get any financial aid. I reappealed but dont know what the outcome is gonna be
Now the situation is that i have around 25k USD saving and prodigy finance is willing to give me loan of 88k but the whole degree will cost me around 180k. I contacted Agha khan foundation for the scholarship but unfortunately i got my acceptance on 14 March and to apply for 
their program the last date was 15 March. 
Is there any external funding you know which i can apply to or any other solution for my issue.
P.S: its not like its the only school. I have acceptance from 4 other schools in Europe with funding but Columbia’s program is more alligned with my carrer choices. Plus its my dream school.

Alhamdulillah 
Date : 19sep 
Islamabad
Status : Approved 
University: eastern Michigan University 
Course: bachelor’s in mechanical engineering 
Refusal from Australia 
Rejection from uk universities in interview 
Then I connected with Allah and got the result 
I was quite nervous because the officer rejected 3 visas in front of me but also he approved 1 student visa so in the start i was narvous 
VISA officer looking like Chinese or japani wearing galasses 
Me : good morning 
Vo : good morning pass me your documents 
Me : here 
Vo : why are you going to usa?
Me : persue my bachelor’s in mechanical engineering 
Vo : when did you completed your high school degree?

alhamdulillah By the grace of Allah visa approved 
F1-Visa approved 
6th December 
( 
Karachi embassy )
Appointment time 10:00 am 
Visa officer was a lady around 40 or above counter number 5 
Interview experience:
Vo:Good morning 
Me: good morning officer

Embassy: Islamabad
Date: 12 May
Visa Status: Approved
I was a bit nervous and none of my answers went 100% smooth.
Here's how interview went.
VO: Hello(in very friendly tone)
Me: Hi
VO: (After taking my docs and entering them on PC) Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going to attend Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Cincinnati.
VO: (After a pause) Why did you choose this University?
Me: (I stuttered during this answer a bit) I am going because this university is aligned with my research interest.
VO: Why did you choose University of Cincinnati specifically?
Me: Because the lab facilities and faculty is suited to my research in additive manufacturing. It's the same research that I did in my bachelor's. (stuttered here too)
VO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father. (I stopped after saying this for around 20 secs and then started speaking again) He is manager at X and makes Y money through job Z money through rentals and some money thru real estate trading which I don't know how much is.
VO: Cograts. Enjoy your stay at united states.
Me: Thanks.
Thoughts? 
The visa doesn't mostly depend on the interview. The VO wasn't even listening to me with attention. It depends on your uni, course and any funding you have(I had $20k scholarship). My interview wasn't the best. Actually, I would say it was average or below average.
Almost all visas(5/5) got approved before me. Only 2 were refused, who went after me. Those 2 had genuine reasons to refuse. If I were VO, I would even refuse them(not cuz of hate lol but their case didn't seem strong on paper)
Suggestions?
1. Don't go for consultants. They apply for you at few unis which VOs are aware of. VOs don't even consider you in that case. They straight away reject you.
2. Take IELTS. Take GRE. Secure full/partial scholarship(you can easily get it). Then go for visa. You will get it InshAllah.

Sorry for the very long post
Visa Approved Alhamdulillah 
Date: November 15th
Time: 10:30 Am
Karachi Consulate
Counter 7: Middle Aged White Lady
Passport Delivered: November 18th
Arrived in the US: December 23rd
University: Roosevelt University Chicago
I hope this interview experience will give hope to many of you aspiring to apply and study in the US. My profile was far from ordinary and there were so many “Red Flags” that I had very little hope of getting my visa approved. This group has been extremely helpful and supportive in the entire process.
Major Red Flags in my profile:
1. Immigration petition filed for my entire family through my mother back in 2010. (I was not the main applicant so I chose “NO” in the DS-160 question for immigration petition).
2. Sponsored by my Uncle.
3. Low Ranked University no one has heard about before. (I went with it because I had a low CGPA).
4. No scholarship at all.
5. No recent travel history.
6. Lots of family in the US.
Interview:
VO: Hi, Passport and I-20 please.
Me: Hi, there you go.
VO: Why are you going to the US?
Me: For a Master’s Degree in Computer science.
VO: Why go for a masters if you already have a bachelor’s degree?
Me: Bachelor’s is the first step for me, since I want to do research in my field in the future, Master’s is needed before I go for a PhD.
VO: Oh so you want to do a PhD?
Me: Yes, after I complete this master’s degree.
VO: PhD in what?
Me: AI and Machine Learning.
VO: Okay, what specifically in AI and Machine Learning?
Me: Augmented Driving Systems.
VO: Oh that’s nice (with an impressed look). So why did you choose this University? And how did you find it?
Me: Well honestly, I applied to about 9 universities and only 3 accepted me — among those 3, this one was the best choice in terms of ranking and other factors. (Then I named all 9 universities).
VO: Did anyone help you find this university?
Me: Uhmm, just the internet and some friends.
VO: Okay, and who is your sponsor?
Me: My uncle will be my sponsor.
VO: What does he do?
Me: He is a Director of XYZ at XYZ (Semi Gov Institution).
VO: Nice, what about your parents? What do they do?
Told
VO: Okay and does your uncle have any children?
Me: He doesn’t have any children of his own but he does have an adopted son who is young, about 5 years old right now.
VO: Okay and do you have any siblings?
Me: Yes, I have a sister. She is becoming a Chartered Accountant and is doing her Articles now. She has about 2 years left to complete that.
VO: Okay okay, and do you have any family in the US?
Me: Yes, my uncles.
VO: Oh, your other uncles?
Me: Yes.
VO: (While looking at my I-20), do they live in….
Me: I interrupted her and said no, they live in NY my university is in Chicago.
VO: Okay… everything seems to be good. I am approving your Visa and we will keep your passport, remember you cannot enter the US before December 16th.
Me: Yes, I know. Thank you officer have a nice day. Good bye.
My only advice is to Keep your Faith in Allah, ask for your wishes in Dua and be confident. If Allah wants something for you it will happen.
If any of you need any information please feel free to send me a DM and I will do my best to help you.

***APPROVED***
LOCATION KARACHI
TIME SLOT 8.30
BUSINESS ANALYTICS (MS)
INTERVIEWER: INFAMOUS ASIAN
NO GRE
NO IELTS
GPA 2.86
Date: 8th June.
DISCLAIMER: My interview was very different from others so please don't take it as a guide as I don't want to mislead anyone.
After preparing myself for straight 20 days I went for an Interview, I was prepared for every kind of question, but there was something else written in my fate.
VO DID NOT ASK ANY COMMON QUESTIONS LIKE:
Why US? 
Why this university?
Rather he started like this
1) what are your daily responsibilities in your current job?
2) what does your father do? (Convinced with my one word ANSWER)
3) what are your plans after graduation? (Told him the names of 3 it companies name where I'm aiming to work at)
4) do you have any relatives? I said yes because I didn't want to lie
5) will you leave the current job? I said yes (btw I just joined that job 20 days ago)
Conclusion: All that time he was behaving as if the decision is already decided because he seemed too uninterested to hear my answers. It was like as if he was just completing a formality nothing else.
In a nutshell, for me US F1 VISA IS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON LUCK BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A HEC FUNDED PHD LEVEL GUY GETTING REJECTED WHOSE PROFILE WAS 4X STRONGER THAN MINE.
BUT GO WELL PREPARED AND BE CONFIDENT. I ALSO GREETED HIM IN A VERY LOUD VOICE. Also don't forget to pray and take your mother's prayers as they can do wonders.
GOODLUCK!
Thankyou 
Rana Ibrar
 for helping me throughout this journey.

Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

Interview Status: Approved
Date: Sept 2013
I see a similar post where a member shared his/her past approval process so I wanted to share mine as well to give our members some confident
My 
interview took only 2 to 3 minutes and I still remember our conversation
I passed my i20 to interviewer and he asked following questions.
IO: Which University?
Me: Webster University, st louis MO
IO: Which program
Me: MS Finance
IO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father and handed him his business card.
He did look his card for few minutes. Not to mention i did bring all bank statements, educational documents with me but he didn't see anything
After few moments, IO said I am approving your visa Congratulations. No further questions asked why this program etc!
I remember when I was leaving embassy with smile, the security guard said you are the 1st person till now who is going out with smile 
Now after almost 10 years, i am US citizen already.
No, i did not over stayed my visa, nor filed for asylum or looked for short cuts here. I did finish my masters, opt, employer sponsorship and then citizenship. If you think getting married with US citizen will give you a chance here, so be prepared there is a chance if you are honest but getting married here to obtain citizenship only will not only put your immigration application as fraudulent but also you may be banned from getting US citizenship. It was easy before to get immigration through this way but not anymore.
There is NO short cut in US immigration. If you are already here, focus on the purpose why you are here. Concentrate on your studies and take it from there. Trust me, even after studies if you dont get any chance of immigration here, with your US educational degree, you can achieve so much anywhere. All the best!
Those who are applying for visa, good luck to you all. If you don't get it please don't get disheartened. Its all about luck and destiny. As everyone wants to live American life, its not easy at all

VISA APPROVED
Date: 19thMay 2023
Program: PhD in Engineering Education (Fully funded)
University: State University of New York at Buffalo
location: US Embassy Islamabad
VO 
was a middle aged lady with glasses
Me: Good Morning Officer (Meanwhile I had already passed my passport, I 20, SEVIS and DS-160)
VO: Good Morning. Is it your first time here?
Me: Yes, I have never been here before.
VO: So where are you going?
Me:  I plan to go to SUNY Buffalo for my PhD in Engineering Education and it is a fully funded offer with an assistantship.
VO: How did you come to know about this PhD?
Me: Well the desire to do my PhD in this field stemmed from my surroundings. Throughout my educational and professional career, I noticed that Engineering is considered to be male dominant field. Somewhere deep down I wanted to change that and for this exact reason I plan to do my research in “Diversity and inclusion in Engineering education”.  (I was not interrupted at all by VO so I kept on talking). Although PhD in this field is being offered by other US universities as well but I chose this university cuz I had read a few research papers of Prof xyz so I dropped  her an email expressing my interest to work with her to which she replied then we had a zoom a session and she agreed to supervise me provided I can get myself admitted by meeting the requirements of graduate school. I then applied at uni portal and not only did I get admitted but I was also offered a full scholarship.
That was a long answer but I just did not wanna stop until I was interrupted so I kept going.
VO:  So you have assistantship?
Me: Yes I do have it.
VO: So what exactly would you do in your research?
Me: There would basically be 3 major research questions and then went on to state all 3 of them.
VO: Tell me how as a male you came to realize the underrepresentation of women in engineering?
Till now, VO would ask me a question and then would start typing on the computer and would occasionally make an eye contact. But after asking this question, she took both her hands off keyboard and placed on the table as if she was very eager to listen to my answer.
Me:  When I was doing my bachelors, there were only 2 girls in a class of 50 people. During the fours years of my professional career, there was only a handful of representation of female members of the society and even those who were there, they would put in a resign after sometime. So I always had it in back of my hand that if we are not taking measures to make our educational institutes diverse and inclusive then we would have to bear severe economical repercussions.
VO: Do you have bachelor's in STEM?
Me: Yes, I did my bachelor's in electronics engineering.
VO: Which school would you be joining in UB?
Me: School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
VO kept typing for few seconds and then out came the golden words. Your visa is approved and she handed me over the blue slip.
Well in my view giving confident answers by maintaining  eye contact with the VO does make a massive difference. VO did not ask for anything from me not even my own CV. The other thing is being proactive in the interview can pass you off as someone who knows what he is doing.

Visa Approved in the third attempt!
Sharing this experience as a hope for many of you guys who will be appearing in their third attempt. I was refused twice in May and June from Islamabad Consulate. I applied again with the same profile after deferring my admission in the Karachi Consulate. 
I was refused first time around for showing myself self sponsoring my education even though I wasn't doing any job and my father had given me the funds back then too. It was a blunder from 
my side in the first attempt. 
2nd time around, the interview lasted only a minute, before visa officer refused me without asking any major questions. It was quite tough to gather the confidence for applying again after such an interview. 
Interview on 26th October.
University of Houston.
Master's in Industrial Engineering.
Karachi Consulate. 
Visa officer was an American Male in his 40's. 
When I reached the counter, we greeted each other and after that there was a pause of around 2-3 minutes without Vo asking me anything as he was going through my profile. 
Vo: Tell me about your parents.
My mother is a housewife. My father is an industrialist, we have have a business of manufacturing of adhesives and lubricants which my grandfather started 50 years back and after him his sons are managing it now and also the reason why I want to do industrial engineering, as I have to comeback and manage it afterwards.
Vo: In how many uni's did you apply?
I applied to a total of 5 uni's, out of which I got accepted into 4 of them. I applied to Clemson University where I got rejected from, and I got acceptances from UIC, USF, FSU and UOH where I'm going. Among them I choose University of Houston because Houston is a big industrial city and UOH has strongly industrial affiliated faculty. There are couple of professors at UOH, who take their students for industrial visits every week as part of their curriculum which enhance their practical knowledge which I'm looking for. 
I was quite animated at this moment and was making some hand gestures which annoyed the Vo. He asked me to stop doing that and answer him as I was talking to a friend. 
Vo: So you have one brother who is handling your family business? (I don't know where he got this from)
I told him that I have two elders brothers and they are also handling the business and well.
Vo: Have your brothers also studied from aboard?
No. They have got their education in Pakistan. 
Vo: Why do they want to send you abroad?
Told the visa officer how many brothers always wanted me to get the exposure and how they have always encouraged me to pursue education from abroad. I did an Aiesec internship in 2019, mentioned that too.
After this the Vo stopped asking questions and tried to make a decision but he was undecided at this time. I asked him I could help him with anything else but he said that he is not sure either way right now. I asked him should I tell him about why choose Industrial Engineering in the first place. He said no and that I would have read the website and would just pour it all out on him. 
I said no, just let me explain why I wanted to do Industrial Engineering.
Told him about Industrial Engineering and how USA is the pioneer of this field and that only a couple of uni's in germany and canada are offering this course with the same curriculum. Also mentioned that I have acceptances from Canada and Australia as well but I choose USA because of their quality etc.
Vo: Did your Visa also got rejected from Canada and Australia?
No. I didn't apply for Visa there, as I wanted to study Industrial Eng and my courses were different there.
Vo was still undecided trying to make a decision.
Vo: How big is your industry.
Told him about the number of people working there.
Vo: Okay, tell me about your time at Turkey.
Told him about Aiesec and how this internship gave me exposure and boosted my confidence etc. 
Eventually, the Vo handed me the blue slip. 
Vo: Enjoy your time in the USA.

vo: purpose of traveling to USA?
me: well officer I am going to usa for my professional pilot training from pelican flight training llc which is in miami Florida (I noticed he was still listening to me so I continued speaking)the reason I selected us because American pilot license is a very demanding pilot license in the aviation industry and as I plan to start my Career here in pakistan as an airline pilot after completing my training from usa so getting my pilot license from will really help me to increase job job opportunities for me here in pakistan as a pilot because all the airlines of pakistan accepts the American pilot license and prefer the American trained pilots that's why I'm emphasizing on going to us for my flight training program. although I also searched about flight training programs in uk and gulf countries as well but in uk programs are 4 years long and cost is 2 times than usa where as in gulf programs r 5 years long and r 3 times expensive than usa and I am in also in contact with few pilots In pakistan did their from us they also recommend me to go to usa for flight training as it will increase job opportunities for me here in pakistan.
vo:what is an aileron?
me:well sir aileron is an primary flight control system of the aircraft attached to the wings of the aircrafts and r connected to the yokes or side sticks of the aircraft and r used to turn the aircraft in the air the ailerons r also connected to the turn indicator of the plane which is an important instrument in the cockpit helps the pilots to see the turn angle of the aircraft.
vo:(hands over the blue slip) enjoy ur stay in usa
me:thank u sir when can I have my passport?
vo: 5 din baad
 I left then counter and thanked ALLAH for the accepting my prayers 
I also had a session with argo visa to prepare for my next attempt the session really helped me they gave me advice not to stop speaking till vo is listening and the advices they gave me to fulfill ds160 specially the section in which we have to mention the reason of our refusal o followed their advices.
and ALSO make dua from ALLAH to give u what u want. make dua between Alan and iqamah as PROPHET MUHAMMAD(P.B.U.H) said supplications made between Azan and iqamah r never rejected (tirmidhi 3594)
make dua in tahajjud as well because if u really want some thing something pray tahajjud for it 
and whenever u make dua forst recite dua of HAZRAT YUNUS A.S THAT he recited in belly of whale then make dua ALLAH WILL accept ur dua its also an hadith of PROPHET MUHAMMAD(P.B.U.H) WHOEVER recites the dua of YUNUS A.S and makes dua ALLAH WILL ACCEPT HIS DUA

F1 status: Approved Alhamdulilah MashaAllah 
Date: 24th June 2023
Interview time: 9:15am
Actual interview: 11:45am 
Karachi Consulate 
Although there were few minor mishaps that happened too that day but i tried to remain calm and relaxed throughout and managed to convince the VO to approve my visa Alhamdulilah. At first i wasn’t given any token number and when i realized that i have no token number, i went back and got token number of much later time 
 Next, i was instructed to bring another passport size photo from the nearest studio as early as possible as my current picture wasn’t acceptable since i was wearing a hijab and some sides were not visible (according to them). Anyways, i went to the nearest studio (Dosani’s) and came back after an hour. And waited half an hour more to have my interview. 
I greeted him, he ignored and had a straight bezaar face. VO was a male. He asked me to pass my documents. I did. 
VO: So why are you going to US
Me: To pursue dual Masters in public informatics and urban planning from Rutgers University, New Jersey.
VO: Hold on, whats public informatics? Is it related to public health? 
Me: No its not related to public health, its related to data analytics. I tried explaining him the relevancy of this field with my field and how it aligns with my bachelors degree. He was listening me carefully and even typed it on his computer and i think read it online too on Rutgers website. I even mentioned few data related courses like GIS, Envi, python and he was like now whats GIS? So I explained him in detail about that too. 
VO: Okay so i see you have also gotten a 60% scholarship. How are you managing remaining funds? 
Me: My family is going to sponsor my education; that includes my father and two brothers. 
VO raised his eyebrows and looked at me.
I gave him my father’s background and of my brothers background. He asked me to pass their financial documents. He carefully saw each of those documents and verified the amount that i was stating while telling him about my father and brothers earnings and savings. I also told him about couple of investment lands that we own and their worth in dollars. 
Vo: Whats the status of your brothers in US?
Me: One of them is on H1B and another one has just started his professional hybrid masters program. 
Vo: Okay and what are your future plans? 
Me: Told
By that time he already took out a paper which i didn’t see which color that was. But he seemed satisfied and was smiling. 
Me: Last but not the least, one interesting fact is that when i first visited USA back in 2020, I got the chance to explore the campus of Rutgers New Brunswick, so this was also one of the reasons of selecting Rutgers apart from scholarship and its outstanding reputation. I am familiar with the place and have explored the campus for days. 
Vo: Thats wonderful. Congratulations i am approving your Visa. Im keeping your passport. Thankyou. Bye bye 
Me: Thankyou so much. Have a nice day. 
My advice: Be confident and well prepared. And dont be hideous at all. They already know everything about you and I could’ve said something else on the question of my brothers status but i chose to be honest and straightforward. 
Best of luck to everyone. Prayers for all. 
Allahumma Barik

Got my visa approved today. ALHUMDULILLAH. Here is my experience.
Degree and College: MS Mechanical Engineering from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.
Semester: Spring '24
Consulate: Karachi
Date: 21-08-23
VO 
was a middle-aged white man.
VO: Hi!
Me: Hello! good morning.
VO: Pass me these documents (I had my passport, I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation in my hand)
Me: Sure. There you go.
VO: (After looking at my documents) How old are you?

He has high regards for the work done by Dr. XYZ, he is a professor in the mechanical department of SIUE. Further upon my research I got to know that it is a notable institute in the Midwestern region. I also found the Uni to be affordable and upon completion of my admission process, I also recieved a scholarship of $8,000, which helped me finalising my decision to choose SIUE.
(VO hardly maintained any eye contact all this time)
VO: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Me: I have one younger brother.
VO: What do your parents do?
Me: My mother is a teacher at XYZ school and my father is a government employee in the ministry of XYZ as an Assistant Officer.
(He got a little confused at assistant officer, I had to tell him again and also mentioned my father's grade to him)
For a minute or so he kept typing something on his computer. And after a minute gave me my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation back.
At this point I was thinking that he didn't give me my passport back to me but then I saw him taking out a blue slip and eventually kept my mouth shut 
VO: There you go. (Not even a congratulations 
)
Me: Thank you. When can I have my passport back?
VO: You will receive an email in a week or so.
Me: Alright. Have a nice day. 
He only asked me 4 questions out of which I guess only 2 were relevant to my interview. He didn't ask for any single document other than my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation. I stayed confident, and maintained my tone but all of that wasn't even looked at 
. He already refused 2 F-1 candidates right infront of me and I was really scared but Alhumdulillah everything went far better than I expected. 
My question now is, how long will it take to get my passport back and when does the visa status on the portal gets updated??
Any questions are welcomed.

Visa approved after 221g (administrative processing)
AOA
I finally received a visa after 40 days of administrative processing.
University: Cleveland State University
Sponsor: Cousin living in the US
Embassy: Islamabad
Interview date: 03 Aug 2022
Passport received: 20 Sep 2022
Interview experience: VO only asked about my program and current job while constantly typing. He was not asking anything else but just typing, I was telling him about my graduation, sponsor and future goals. He was just saying OK in reply. He then told me he will need some more information via email and returned my passport.
So, i want to share my experience what observed so far, it might be helpful for someone.
First and the most important thing is the believe in Allah and Duas from parents.
Practice interview in front of a mirror or laptop camera.
Prepare the answers to common questions from VO and analyze them until you get confidence that they are according to your case because only you know the best about yourself. Tell him like a story and show your accomplishments. No doubt, university and sponsorship matter but the most important thing that matters is how you are presenting your case if it makes sense then all OK. Your whole profile matter.
One last important thing which we often ignore, please be dressed as it depicts how serious you are about your study or the concerned post. They judge you from the very moment when you get up from the chair and move towards the window.
Best of luck all.
Thanks!

1st Attempt: Approved Alhumdulillah.
Interview was at 25th May Karachi Consulate.
Profile: BS from LUMS, going for MS Finance at University of Houston. Had Received out-of-station tuition waiver and additional scholarship as well. Have been working at Multinational bank for almost two years now.
VO: 
Pass me your passport and F1.
VO:  Why university of Houston?
ME: Firstly, the courses which they are offering, related to derivates trading and hedging and this is where my professional experience lies, as I have been working in the banking industry for over 2 years now, and I feel this degree would help me fill in the gaps in my skill set.
Also, one of my university professors had recommended this course and degree, as he had also completed his master’s from there.
Also, I have been following Professor XYZ, throughout my undergraduate phase, and read his publications on hedging techniques, so I thought it would be quite an experience to take live lectures from him.
VO: interesting!
VO: What is your job ?
ME: Told him about the general job description, routine tasks etc.
VO: Plans after graduation.
ME: Obviously, the plan is to complete my master’s with good GPA. And then to focus on my banking career, as employers in the Pakistani banking sectors tend to value those profiles and individuals who have done their education specifically from US Colleges. In fact, my current supervisor had done his Master’s from abroad, and at a very young age he is doing quite well. I have a similar objective, I believe this degree would help me to excel in the Pakistan banking sector, also that I have made good repo with my supervisor, he would be willing to hire me at a senior position, once I complete my master’s.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME:  it is my father.
VO: What is his profession?
ME: He is a banker as well, and currently working in one of the banks in UAE.
VO: Pass me the statement.
I handed over the statement to him.
VO: Your credentials are good, I am approving your visa. You will get your passport in a week.
For all the aspirants out here, the only thing matters is your level of confidence and communication skills. Regardless of the circumstances, and whatever is the outcome, just give your 100% and maintain eye-contact.

Visa Interview Experience!
Status: APPROVED! Alhamdulillah.
Karachi Consulate 
Masters in Engineering Management
Interview date: 16 June 2023
Time: 8:00 AM
VO  was a lady in her early 30’s
Me: Hey! Good Morning Mam
VO: Good Morning, How are you?
Me: I am Fine, what about you?
VO: I am fine too. Thanks for asking. Pass me your documents.
Me: Sure.
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going to pursue my Masters degree in Engineering management from XYZ University.
VO: Which degree have you recently completed?
Me: I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from XYZ University in karachi.
VO: When did you graduated?
Me: I graduated in October 2022.
*She was constantly typing on computer, there was 5-6 seconds gap after this question, so I started telling her that when I was in USA  in 2021, so I visited this university physically and met the ABC professor and ABC Professor, they both cooperate with me so much, and Dr. ABC gave me whole university tour, and also show me the research facility of Engineering management including all labs.*
VO: You were on your pleasure trip so why did you go to this city? As it is not a tourist city. Did you just go to specially visit this university?
Me: No no, I was on tour of Las vegas, los angeles and Orlando but in last I visited this city because my cousin live just 30 minutes away from this city, and he was giving me tour of beaches and several museums, during that I saw this university and planned to visit it on other day. My cousin is also a F1 student, studying in XYZ University.
VO: Oh Ok! So you were visiting your cousin in that city.
Me: Yes Mam.
VO: In how many universities did you applied?
Me: I just applied in this university, because I have physically visited this university so I was well aware of this university and city. As my CGPA is …….., so you know there are few better universities where we could apply.
VO: *nodded her head* Yes, you are right.
Me: As there is no consultant involved in my case, all I have done by my own after doing proper research between few universities. Rather than wasting my money and time by applying to several universities, I just focused on few universities and finalized this one. I also got a scholarship of ……… amount.
VO: You have done a good job! So what’s your plan to do ahead, I mean in which sector do you want to do certifications or job?
Me: I want to go towards the sustainable energy sector, as my FYP was also regarding that so I have much information on sustainable energy. 
*I explain here my FYP in few lines*
VO: Interesting. So tell me about your masters degree that is there just generally engineering management or you have to take any selective sub-field in that?
Me: In this university, there are several sub-field under engineering management, such as robotics and automation, supply chain management, civil engineering focus, Industrial Engineering focus, Mechanical engineering focus and chemical engineering focus.
VO: So, what you are going to pick?
Me: I will choose mechanical engineering focus, as my bachelors is in same field so I have a vast knowledge of it.
VO: Right! Why did you want to do masters degree?
Me: If I would be just having bachelors degree so it would be having not that much worth. If I want to get promoted to higher level so I must have a masters degree too. Well, I selected this program rather than selecting same program as my bachelors, the main reason is that if you want to go to management level post like to the highest post like CEO, so you must have management degree. What mostly engineers do is that they pursue simple MBA for this reason, and I think that if I would be doing MBA which is a business degree, after my BE Mechanical, so it would be like that I am throwing my technical field degree in dust bin. Therefore, I choose this program which is combination of management and engineering fields.
VO: Ok, right! What are you doing right now like are you studying any course or doing any job or something else?
Me: I am currently working in XYZ company as a mechanical engineer, you may see in my application that I have written NO in job section because when I booked my appointment so till then I was unemployed, but after 2 days of it I got a call from my CEO for vacant position of mechanical engineer. This is the same company where I had done my 2 months internship in month of December and January, as I was having a good working relation with my CEO so I asked him during my last days of internship that if there would be any vacancy of engineer post so he must let me know. I’ll be going on study leave, and it has been granted to me along with surety that when I will be back so I will be promoted to XYZ post due to my masters in engineering management. Do you want to see those letters?
VO: No, I don’t want to see anything, just you tell me verbally, its ok.
*she was constantly typing, so to gain her attention I start talking about my Exchange program trip to USA in 2016, where we were guest of University of Toledo, after hearing this she start talking to me again*
VO: So how long was your trip?
Me: It was just for 15 to 16 days, and I also got just 20 days visa for it. You may see it in my passport.
VO: Yeah, most of the time for exchange program, only limited time visa is granted. So, when you were in that city where you are going to do masters, what did you like there and what did you didn’t like?
Me: I love it, the calmness, its nature and the people are so much caring and lovely. There is not a single thing which I could say that I didn’t like. 
VO: Not a single thing! There must be anything that you may have thought that this shouldn’t be like this?
Me: No mam, seriously, there is not a single thing like that. That whole city is amazing.
VO: Good. Ok! (She start smiling ) So I am approving you visa. Good luck for your trip to USA. Hope you will like it. Well, we are also conducting pre-departure orientation ( she gave me blue slip along with the orientation pamphlet), I would suggest you to register yourself and must attend this, it would be helpful.

Date: 14th October 
Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

I was very nervous when I arrived at the embassy, but when I went inside and saw the relaxed environment, I started feeling more at ease. The atmosphere was very comfortable, and seeing that made my confidence boost. I spoke with the Visa Officer in a friendly manner, as if I was having a conversation with a friend. I had prepared long answers, but during the interview, I only spoke when necessary and avoided giving unnecessary details.
I want to tell all of you that feeling nervous is valid. It's okay to be nervous, and that's completely normal. Just don't stress out. I can't express how nervous and stressed I was, but once I was there, the environment made it easy, and I was able to manage my nervousness. One more important thing: hold on tightly to your faith in ALLAH. Our success is not because of our efforts alone, it's by the will of Allah. Get close to Him and put your trust in Him. Pray Tahajjud and Nawafil, and have faith in every aspect of your journey. They really helped me stay relaxed.
Additionally, this group also played a significant role in helping me. If your DS-160 form is filled out correctly, you have all the required tests and documents, then you're on the right track to get your visa.

F-1 Visa Interview Experience
Status: Approved
Date: 1st April, 2024
Time: 7:30
Location: Islamabad 
Profile: Ohio university with a 18k scholarship (only 6k of tuition left) I already have a Canadian and US visit visa.
VO: a white man with a thick beard on the first counter (14 I think?)
(for privacy reasons, I will be redacting some people and institutes)
VO: Good morning. Can you give me your passport and I-20?
me: Good morning (gave him the documents)
VO: Why are you choosing Ohio University?
me: While OU is a well-ranked university, three factors influenced my decision to choose OU. The first factor is the Entrepreneurship honors program which I have been accepted to, which I believe, in addition to my degree, will help me develop and hone skills to be a successful individual. Secondly, As you can see from my I-20, I have been awarded a generous scholarship of $18,000, which helps me immensely financially. The third factor is Familial Support; My eldest brother is doing his [REDACTED] in [REDACTED NEIGHBOURING STATE] with a non-immigrant J-1 visa. Although I will be staying on campus to get the most out of campus life, having that familial support will help me transition better into the US culture.
VO: Do you have another sibling in [REDACTED]?
me: Yes, my second eldest brother.
VO: (typed for a few seconds) Did you get any other funding? (looking at my I-20)
me: Yes actually, I got an additional 3000$ from the University's honors program but they were not able to update my I-20 as the award was awarded after the I-20 was issued (so that brought my total scholarship to 18K a year)
VO: How are you gonna pay for the rest?
me: well my second eldest brother, who is a [REDACTED JOB TITLE] at [REDACTED COMPANY NAME] in [REDACTED NON-US COUNTRY] has offered to sponsor my studies.
VO: Do you have a valid B1/B2 Visa?
Me: Yes, I do.
 VO: which school did you go here? (I though he said why don't I go to a school here)
me: (started answering)
VO: Yes but that was not what I asked, I asked which school did you go to here?
Me: oh sorry, I thought you asked something else. (told him my school name)
VO: any previous schools?
me: yes ( told him the name)
VO: thank you. Please collect your passport in a week.
Thoughts: So I would say don't hide anything from them first of all. I have a brother in the States and told them about it blatantly because they already know it, so, there is no use hiding if you have someone in the US. Be confident about it. Second, If you have any additional info about your I-20 or any changes in it please inform them, they understand that there can be problems like I had, with international students. If you mishear anything, that's also fine. Don't panic, stay clam and inshallah you will get it.

F-1 Visa Interview Experience
Status: Approved
Date: 1st April, 2024
Time: 7:30
Location: Islamabad 
Profile: Ohio university with a 18k scholarship (only 6k of tuition left) I already have a Canadian and US visit visa.
VO: a white man with a thick beard on the first counter (14 I think?)
(for privacy reasons, I will be redacting some people and institutes)

VO: Good morning. Can you give me your passport and I-20?
me: Good morning (gave him the documents)
VO: Why are you choosing Ohio University?
me: While OU is a well-ranked university, three factors influenced my decision to choose OU. The first factor is the Entrepreneurship honors program which I have been accepted to, which I believe, in addition to my degree, will help me develop and hone skills to be a successful individual. Secondly, As you can see from my I-20, I have been awarded a generous scholarship of $18,000, which helps me immensely financially. The third factor is Familial Support; My eldest brother is doing his [REDACTED] in [REDACTED NEIGHBOURING STATE] with a non-immigrant J-1 visa. Although I will be staying on campus to get the most out of campus life, having that familial support will help me transition better into the US culture.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT HISTORY:
I had my both attempts from Karachi counsellete and with the same Webster University. First Interview was a detailed one. VO asked me all about the application. She might got confused with my financials because I didn't explained all about my sponser's finacial.
Second attempt was pathetic. VO didn't ask much. He was constantly staring at the screen and was reading previous notes. At that moment I was loosing my confidence and becoming anxious.After wasting 3-4 minutes he just asked 3 or 4 questions about my profile that I answered. Again i got refused under section 214(b). It was like that he already made his decision earlier.

Interview Status - Approved 
Date: November 2011
Visa Counselor (VC): Good morning
Me: Good morning, How are you?
VC: 
Good. So why are you going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Oral Biology from Uni of Louisville, Kentucky. It’s a research based program. 
VC: How many programs did you apply?
Me: I applied to 5 programs all over the world and got accepted in all of them. 2 in Germany, 1 in UK, 1 in Canada and 1 in US. 
VC: why US?
Me: Because I emailed the professor and he liked my past research projects. His area of research aligns with my future research endeavors. That’s why I would like to pursue this program. 
VC: Who is sponsoring your studies?
Me: I saved some money working for almost 2 years and my dad has some savings. (Tuition and living cost for 2 years was $45,000. I had managed to bring a six month bank statement of $45,550 
My contributions in that was $550 only 
. Rest of the money was loan from family and friends. Everybody chipped in there life savings). She didn’t see that bank statement document so that was a waste of effort. 
VC: Did you give any standardized tests to get admission in this program?
Me: Yes, I gave Toefl and Gre (Handed her the Toefl and Gre report). (Toefl -115)
VC: I see you have two attempts at GRE? 
Me: yes, I didn’t get good scores in Quantitative section in the first attempt so I waited for 5 months and gave it again. I improved my score by 40th Percentile ). 
VC: Do you have any family member in US?
Me: No. 
VC: Unfortunately, you have applied late for the visa interview. You’ll need to ask for another i-20 from your university. (Proceeds to give me a piece of paper saying Administrative Processing). 
Me: Okay thank you, have a good one. 
Administrative processing took 6 months. 
Got the visa. Now , I am a US and Canadian citizen. 
Was it worth it? Would I do it again? NO. 
Because it was too hard. 
I was stupid and ignorant. I didn’t know any better. I believe that’s why I was able to do it. Sometimes ignorance is a blessing in disguise. 
Over the last decade or so, I saw Pakistan going from bad to worse. Inflation, joblessness and despair increased far more rapidly than any other neighboring country. As an overseas Pakistani all I could do is watch from abroad. Because I’ll admit. It’s too hard to solve our own problems. People who tried to do it, are in jail these days. And really, all they wanted was to do something good for the nation. But I guess, I still have hope. One day to return Pakistan, may be serve my own people. May be…one day….
Reason for sharing this post- I do see rejections on this group. I do see hopelessness. Guys- trust me, never lose hope. This one decision changed my life forever. But I was mentally prepared to go to UK or Germany or stay in Pakistan. I had faith in Allah that whatever will happen will be for the best. 
The visa counselor did not like me. Infact , from her face I could tell that she didn’t like me at all. But Allah had my journey written here. 
Best of luck everyone and don’t lose hope.

Visa interview experience 
Date: 13 NOV 2023 
Karachi consulate 
Approved and Issued 
Q1: 
What's your course 
Ans: It's MS marketing analytics 
Q2: Why do you want to study this course
Ans: Having worked for over 4 years in the marketing industry I have observed a technological shift that requires me to have in depth knowledge in both advanced marketing and data analytics, with modules SQL for analytics which will allow me to analyze data in a matter of hours that takes me a week to do right now and data visualization 
Q3: The moment I said data visualization the VO straight away asked me a cross question ""so what is data visualization""
Ans: We marketers have to translate complex raw data from digital marketing campaigns into easy understandable presentations for our clients, stakeholders and most importantly decision making, this process is visualization 
Q4: why from Illinois Tech? 
Ans: IIT offers a research based module in electives that is in collaboration with IBM which is one of the biggest names in analytical tools and software so the additional certificate I will be getting along with the liberty to choose modules from the school of computer science like AI will enhance my portfolio.
Q5: How did you achieve this scholarship 
Ans: I had 3.6 CGPA in my undergrad and have a 4 year work experience so a combination of both was considered.
Q6: How do you plan to pay the rest of the expenses 
Ans: My father will be taking care of those expenses (explained his source of earning)
The VO went silent for 30 seconds, and then told me that my Visa is approved. 
We were very casual in our conversation, maintained an eye contact, I fumbled while saying ""collaboration"" and I literally giggled and corrected myself. 
Everybody is very helpful inside the consulate,  very accommodating, Stress is usually inside our heads, Trust in ALLAH and then trust yourself, be genuine.  
JazakALLAH. And may you all succeed in your ambitions. AMEEN.

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Embassy: Islamabad
Status : Approved
Applied by myself
After greeting, VO said my name and I nodded in response
Why are you going to US
I'm going for studies
You're going to Harvard. Great. What are you going to study?
Differential equations
Differential equations?
Yes, my concentration is differential equations although it says liberal arts on the document.
Why do you want to study these?
I'm a teacher and need to learn them so I can teach it to my students.
How was the application process?
(VO was asking about admission application and I thought he meant visa application) Most people said I should get an advisor or counsellor but I did it myself, didn't find it very complicated.
(VO interrupted) 
Did you apply and get accepted for it or just signed up?
I had to apply and go through the admission process.
OK. How do you plan to pay for it?
From my savings.
How much  do you have?
I shared the amount.
Are you married?
Yes
Any kids?
No.
Is your wife going with you?
No she's not. (I wanted to explain why, but didn't)
Have you changed your name before?
No, I haven't.
OK. It says you were Akmal (not real name) before?
My family calls me that endearly. It hasn't been my official name. 
OK I'm approving your visa. You'll get your passport in some days.
I asked how long it will take and he said its on the blue slip.
VO kept typing throughtout these questions and there were long pauses between questions. He didn't ask me for any supporting documents apart from the usual sevis fee, visa fee, DS 160 and Passport.
I was very nervous because he refused 3 people before me and only one approval. At the last minute I told myself that this person is a gatekeeper and I have to go to US nomatterwhat. I focused on why I was there and where I wanted to be, instead of focusing on people around me. Confidence is key. He could have refused me for my ans to last question but I clarified and was confident which I think helped.
ایسا لگ رہا ہے جیسے برسوں کا بوجھ ہٹ گیا ہو۔ 
I was refused visa for UK 4 years ago despite having an offer from University of Cambridge and it took me 3 years to save the money for this program.
I'd like to thank Tahir Haneef for helping me clear my doubts and for questions I had. I'd also like to thank you all for this group and the moderators. I did multiple mock interviews using different questions from previous posts here.
BTW nobody tells you about the whole gruesome process of going to shuttle stop, the exorbitant fee for it, multiple queues and security checks. The embassy building is daunting. Also, from the moment I stepped out of embassy to until I left the shuttle stop, every person I met asked me for mithayi after seeing the blue slip. I hope our workers learn some self respect and stop the begging.

Me:- So Sir, my school has a very comprehensive College Counselling program, I came to know about Union College through my college Counsellor and I applied to 10 Unis and got admission into 7 of those with varying degree of Scholarships . I choose Union because of the trimester system it provides and it being an LAC and the most important part being the finances  that I discussed with my parents and my counsellor .

Me:- My parents, primarily my father.

VO:- Is it a big restaurant? 
Me:- Yes . 
(Big mistake) 
VO:- Whats the name of his restaurant? 
Me:- Tells the name.
(VO searches for the restaurant on google and is unable to find it because the name on the income statements and the actual name were different and I told him the name as per income statement) 
VO:- Your fathers business is not showing up . 
( Gives a very scary look) 
Me:- Try *tells the real name*, you would be able to see my father and a couple of reviews. 
( i said something about the name being changed recently or because of the language thingy, I just spewed words I could think of ) 
VO:- What would you do after your studies? 
Me:- I take immense pride that my mother being a women, has built her own business , so I will return and take that business to new heights.

Me:- These are results of my Internal School exams while I’m waiting for the result of my Cambridge exams.

(VO returned me my documents) 
VO:- I won’t be needing them, you can have them.
(Hands me the blue slip )
VO:- Congratulations, your VISA has been approved and Good Luck with your studies .
( this or something else but I wasn’t able to deduce because of my excitement) 
Me:- Thank you Sir, Have a nice day ! 
1:- The only advise I have is don’t loose your confidence if the there’s a mess up in the interview, I think I messed up a little but Alhumdulilah got the Visa,  just give them all the answers with confidence as well as you can. Try your best and baqi Allah py chor dain . 
2:- Go early, my interview was at 9 30 and I went in at 9 o clock and got into the embassy at 12. 
3:- Get atleast 2 copies of Confirmation letter and your Id card because they take those  before the shuttle service. And if you don’t have these you need to get into the line for photocopy and thats an additional 30 minutes. 
4:- The only options for the shuttle service was 3000 and 5000, and the lady said that I needed to take the premium service because I was getting late.
They try to sell the premium service but it not necessary at all because there is another line outside the embassy. 
5:- Don’t worry about the time , My appointment was scheduled for 9 30 and I was interviewed at 12 15 . 
6:- I had done a mock interview with my college counselor and read a couple of interviews in the group . I read the frequently asked questions mentioned in the post of a Mod. 
Allah Khair krsi.
I’m not an expert but if anybody needs any kind of help feel free to ask .

I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that it's very hard to get cleared in second attempt but never loose hope and stay calm. 
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Me: ok thank you.
THE TRICK IS to be Confident and natural like these questions don’t even matter and don’t get stuck while speaking. Try to stay to the point and not give a comeplete story for every answer you give.
My Experience: I came alone to a place near the embassy to stay. At 1 am I realized My mother hadn’t signed my I-20 I forgot to tell her to sign it.
My friend photostated my I-20 from the call center I worked at and delivered it to my home. 
At 2 am my parents left from Peshawar to give me the signed form. Then they asked to drop me off even tho it was just 5:30, I agreed and found out The roads were blocked and we had to take a long route.
I found out no InDriver no careem no Uber were available at the time. So it was a miracle my family came to drop me off. 
If I hadn’t forgotten to sign my form, my family wouldn’t have had come to drop me off and there’s a chance I would have messed things up 
But Thanks to Allah almighty things worked out.
Moral of the story if it’s written for you it will happen if it’s not Allah has better plans for you. Try try again
Best of Luck everyone May Allah bless us All

Vo. No reply. Give me your i20 and passport
Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world. Degree obtained from usa has much more worth then any of other countries here in pakistan. They also offer practicle courses, flexible education and cultural diversity further enhanced the educational experience. 
Vo. what are you going to study
Me. I going to peruse masters of cyber security.
vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.

Hello everyone,
Recently my visa was refused. I was asked about my relatives in US, I told the VO about my brother. Then he asked about his university so I told him he is in the same university on J1 visa . After that he asked for his passport copy, to which I said I don't have it now. 
Then he asked about my dependant funds. I had personal funds which were sufficient only for 1 year. So the VO said its not enough for five years (as I m going for PhD). I said my father will 
support me in future but he refused my visa under 214b.
Now please tell me whether my visa was refused due to my relative in US or insufficient funds..?

Aoa all,
Yesterday my F1 visa was refused (214-b), I had a scholarship(sponser) from my cousin. He owns a company in NYC. My interview went very good. She refused my Visa after seeing the scholarship letter, no questions after that.
Today I went to a consultant, he told me that last year US made a policy that bank statements can't be used from a person in US. Bank Statements must be from Pakistan. (That's the reason for refusal).
Is 
it true ? Is there any new policy like that ?
Thank you.

After few minutes typing on computer officer gave me pink slip that your visa is approved. 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that it's very hard to get cleared in second attempt but never loose hope and stay calm. 
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

VO: Why did you chose USA?
Me: US have a good reputation in business programs, including Accountancy, US Universities are often accredited by reputable accrediting bodies, including DePaul too. This Recognition can be beneficial for me and will enhance my credibility as well.
VO: Why this University?
Me: DePaul provides a strong foundation in core accounting subjects with Business Subjects, Ethics and General Education Where as most of the other universities only focuses on Core accounting subjects.
Plus, DePaul University gave me a great scholarship of $24,500 per year and awarded me 12 credit hours based on my A level grades. And getting a degree from Accredited International University will add more worth to my profile when I’ll return back to Pakistan.
VO: What were your Grades in A levels?
Me: I’ve got an A in accounting and overall it was 1A, 1B and 1D.

Program: Ms Finance
Islamabad
VO: 
Hay Good Morning
Me: Good Morning
VO: Pass me your passport and I-20
Me: Sure Sir
VO: Put your right hand 4 finger on the scanner
Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

Course: BS Dental Hygiene
University: Utah tech university
Status: Refused 
Appointment date:15 Nov 2023 Islamabad 
VO 
just said next please and I went to the window and passed the documents no greetings or anything else.
VO:Why Utah tech university?
First of all this university gave me direct entry and allowed me to study this program without taking any perquisites or foundation so they saved my 6 months or maybe Upton  a year.
Although the university has its own dental hygiene clinic where I will be able to complete my 1 year residency. After these 2 reasons I took a pause 
VO:Are you going for a residency?
No first there is a 3 year study then we have to do a 1 year  Mandotry residency we may say a house job
. 
VO:Have you applied in any other university in US?
I have applied to two other university university of Minnesota and university of South Dakota but they refused as they don't offer this program to international students and university of Minnesota was just  offering 2 year program
VO:So why this university?
I have already told the main reason that they gave me direct entry and allowed me to study without taking any pre-requisite or foundation and secondly every academic year only 24 students get selected into this program it was quite tough for me to get admitt there and this also shows they are focused on quality of education.
VO:Who is going to sponsor you?
I have 32 thousand usd funds about 9 million PKR in my personal account which I have got from my parents, mother is a vice principal in gov high school and  father own a  business there combined income is about 13 million annually 
VO:How many employees do your father have ?
He has 3 employes
Although my brother is pledge to support me he is a dentist
.

Hello everyone I  previously refused an F1 visa for the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, but now I want to reattempt the visa.I  have received I-20s from both universities(UIUC, university of Texas Arlington (UTA), and it's worth noting that the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign is considered a top-ranked university in civil engineering compared to the University of Texas Arlington.
Now, I would like confirmation on whether I  should change universities for my 
second visa interview or not ?

I 
passed the passport and i20
Vo: what are you going to study.
I am going to study doctorate of business administration.

VO: who going to sponsor you?
I am going to sponsor myself, i have sufficient funds
VO: and where does that funds come from?
I told her that i do job i work as a xxxxx.

After that i figured out that
My university told me the total expenses for 1 year are $15k but in i20 form they mention total expenses for 7 months are $15k. Can that be a reason? Although i showed the available funds of 21k but it was same for 7 months.

Me: so I actually came to know about the University by watching videos of Dr. Edward Rogoff over YouTube. He’s a very famous writer, as well as a former dean of a Long Island University’s school of Business.

VO: 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐝𝐨? 
Me: My mother is a banking officer at BOP, my father is a supervisor of operations at XYZ Company and my grandfather runs the Airline ticketing agency.

VO: 𝐧𝐨. 𝐈 𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮. 
(Long pause, i wanted to speak but I didn’t want to sound desperate so i kept quiet) 
VO: 𝐬𝐨 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐢𝐬 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐚𝐦𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭. 
Me: it is 6 thousand dollars. It isn’t mentioned on my i20 as I received the scholarship after I’d received my i20.

After almost 5 minutes and hovering his hands over the slips, he gave me a yellow Slip. 
VO: 𝐢 𝐚𝐦 𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐲. 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧 𝐅𝟏 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐚 𝐢𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐚𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬.
I was completely shocked as my interview went for more than 15 minutes and he seemed pretty satisfied over my answers. Seeing me, He said SORRY again as i was leaving the counter. 
Haven’t been able to figure out what went wrong and how to overcome this. I have been thinking about my interview and my rejection non-stop since that day. Your suggestions and advisories are really appreciated.

All the time she was interrupted by another lady officer which engaged her in talks, and she was going inside again and again and while asking questions she was writing in her screen,  in whole interview she was in a very good mood and was very casual. I've thought that she'll give me the visa.

Good afternoon everybody!
I was refused in April 2023 (F1 Visa).
Now I have changed my university and would like to appear for the interview again.
Unfortunately, I am not able to secure the date before 21st August 2023.
I 
booked the appointment in 1st week of September, I then talked to my university's International department in this regard and they were more than happy to provide me late arrival approval letter in case of attending the orientation and classes online on the zoom.
I consented and they provided me the late arrival approval letter of 1 month (20/09/2023).
Now I want to know if I could not secure the early dates, would I be able to satisfy my Consular officer with that letter?
Anyone with the same experience got their visa approved?
Please step forward and help me in this regard, I would be more than grateful to get assisted.
Thanks and Jazak Allah.

Hi everyone, 
I appeared for f2 visa and unfortunately it's rejected. Interviewer was lady in Islamabad embassy. 
I need some suggestions to improve for the next time.
Here are the questions that she asked. 
1st 
question:  What is your spouse studying?
Ans: He is doing his PhD from .... university majoring in ...... Engineering 
2nd Questions: when did you guys got married?
Ans: we got married on .... 2023 
3rd Question: how did you guys meet? 
Ans: Mam he was my first cousin so we both knew each other from childhood 
She said something about cousins marriage that I didn't understand because she was not audible to me. And she rejected. 
For F2 visa I don't have anything to change in my visa application. Mostly in the posts people say that VO starts interview by asking that what did you change in the application and why it was rejected last time. I don't have proper answers for both of these questions. 
Please give me your suggestions.  Thanks.

Guidance required from seniors
F1 visa rejected on 7 Dec,2023
Applied through a consultant. He took Rs.6 lacs, a big blunder I made to apply through a consultant. He took assurance to get me a F1 visa 100%. I know that were fairytales(US dollar machine, billionaire, odd jobs then pay your fee, send money home)
One 
of my relative referred him and now he has become stranger too.
Consultant is asking to pay appointment fee again.
My profile:
No bank balance
No proper job experience(in my father’s business and already done with Mba. Consultant didnot show my MBA, and I applied for another Mba)
My situation is quite financially vulnerable
Savings: 1 million PKR
My plan was to get study visa for future immigration. Not for study purpose.
Should I go for another attempt with this profile?
Or 
Should I go for Middle east to find jobs, earn money then again apply for F1 visa??
How to get my credentials from consultant,i.e: US DOCS ID Passwords, etc.
I have wasted the whole year 
Really required your suggestions.

To the people getting rejected: I know it may seem like that you are rejected for no reason and many of you have posted sharing your concerns that you are rejected and have expressed your frustration too. So let me explain you the major reason. Before I explain you the reason let me tell you that I have received two F visas and one J visa with no travel history before my first visa. Currently I am doing my PhD. So one of the major reason is Finances.
Let’s be honest when you 
show bank statements, are you really going to be using those finances? And VO knows that! They know that the 70 lacs you are showing many of you don’t intend to use that money and just showing it to get the visa. After you get the visa, you will start thinking how you will pay for your education. So if you don’t have a full-ride or a loan, or a TA or RA ship you won’t be able to pay for your education. Don’t be misled thinking that you will be able to make sufficient money with an on-campus job, the on-campus job is only sufficient enough to pay for some of your expenses such as food, bills and sometimes rent. You can’t pay tuition and health insurance with a part time job and working full-time or working off-campus during semesters is ILLEGAL! Majority of you are rejected primarily because of your finances because your finance story doesn’t make sense. VO knows the cost of living in US, and cost of tuition, they are mentioned on your I-20. So they are well aware that you won’t be able to furnish this amount and the bank statement that you showed is probably just to show so you can get that visa. 
Yes, not getting the visa is disappointing. But it will be more disappointing once you get to US and can’t pay for your expenses. So again if you don’t have a full-ride, A TA/RA offer or majority tuition scholarship, don’t think that you will be able to manage the finances. 
Hope this helps and clears some doubts. Don’t blame the embassy or the system because if you are eligible for visa, you will get one but if you know deep down that “I am just showing these statements to get visa, I won’t be using this money” than know that VO knows this and you won’t get the visa. 
Best of luck!

I was rejected for this upcoming fall semester. 
To improve my application, I need to find a good ranked university.
The MS programs I am looking for are
Data science
Data analytics
Business Analytics
Computer science
Unfortunately my CGPA was 2.95. But I have a over 2 years of relevant work experience. Hence looking for names where i can get accepted with the CGPA and without mandatory GRE.
After my research many universities are saying that they might consider, but they usually don't. Had the same experience last term alot of money was wasted on application fees.
I will be very thankful if someone suggest me good universities with good rank for the spring semester.

Alert 
My visa was rejected third time yesterday. 
I went for 3rd attempt after 45 days since second attempt. 
Visa 
officer said I can't give you visa because you were rejected two times before but I give you one advice, "" Don't waste your 185$, you will get same answer. Just give yourself some time "". 
Note: I changed universities in all three times. I knew this could be red flag but i thought as long as i have explanation, it won't be an issue. And I was laid off two months before than interview. So I appeared unemployment there but had two years of work experience. 
Question: I have to wait but how long ? Even if i waited, there is strong possibility that i won't get visa because now i have three rejections.  
I'm going to start my another job soon. 
I'm thinking for Fall 2024. 
What else should I do ? 
I'm worried even if i change my profile and waited, still they may reject by seeing three rejections. 
Betray by seeing rejections but don't want to give up. 
Please give me suggestions.

Me: I chose bs business administration as i belong to a business related family, my father and brother both are successful businessmen, i have interest in business as this course will enhance my business skills as ill learn about all aspects of business including economics, marketing, supply chain and information system 
He gave a smile, seemed like he thought i was confident abt my program like know how, and stood up took my passport inside and came back
Him:Why this university?
 I did an internship at an educational consultancy where i got to know about university of UTAH then i did my research and got to know about unique majors that university is providing and big campus situated in 1526 acres, diversification of students, support system for students, i got scholarship of 35000$ across 4 years and last factor was location, which is salt lake city, it is one of the liveable cities in US and top preference for international student because of the business opportunities.
Passed me my docs with rejection slip and said sorry you’re not eligible for the visa under section 214B. 
Can anyone guide me where i went wrong as I cant seem to understand with only two questions how he rejected me. My D160 was perfect also funding and my family ties are also good as I’ll have to come back to takeover my family business.

Interview Advice for those who got rejected in first Attempt.
You may go with the same university but not with the same profile. VO will must ask you what circumstances have you change this time?
Circumstances mean ur academic, professional, financial or personal circumstances…University is not ur circumstance. 
Try to identify the reason of rejection, improve ur profile accordingly and then apply again with a gap of minimum one month for next attempt for same intake
Re-apply 
with no change in ur circumstances would be a waste of time and money.

If you dont get accepted in US in the first try, rather than begging them in 2nd or 3rd try for a visa , just change your country because some of us are not born with silver spoons in our mouth , nor have any businesses to show ties.

Hello guys, I had my visa interview yesterday and it got rejected. During the interview the VO asked me about my bank statement, i showed it to her and then she goes where did all these funds come from? I replied that my father transfered all the funds from our family saving account to this account to carry out my university expenses? She said do you have the statement for the family savings account, I didn’t had it with me that time and after two three questions she rejected 
my visa. also note my father opened this account in December 2022 , do you think this could be the reason for rejection?

Salaam to All
My first visa interview got rejected on 04 august 2023 due to failure of ties to home country and I was admitted to Kent state University in bachelor of Nursing.And i still have new I-20 for spring from Kent state.
For second attempt I applied to many universities like Miami University,University of Michigan-Flint,University if Colorado denver,Texas A& M University and got offer from 3 of them yet,but I changed my subject to Bachelor of accounting to show strong 
home ties to the visa officer because my elder brother is also a Chartered accountant.
Is it a good step to change subject and university both for second attempt?Need guidance from seniors,Thanks in advance.

I need help, 
I have been rejected once on 25th May 2021
Program Master in Engineering Management 
Indiana Institue of Technology.
I have 3.05 CGPA in bachelor.
I 
was first sponsoring by my uncle and he is a US citizen... 
I was rejected in interview.
I have taken admission in university in the same state where my uncle lives.
Now, for 2nd time, what can I do? 
Can I change university and go with the same sponsor or not? 
Actually, my father in Pakistan has no cash money in bank and all are invested in property.
So, I have no bank statement in Pakistan 
So, if I arrange 50,60Lacks from invester so I must pay 2.5 Lac to him 
So, I want to know that is there any chance of visa if I change my university and get admission in other state where my uncle is not living and go with same sponsor (my uncle) or not?
Your replies would highly appreciated

Interview date = 11 Aug
Location = Karachi consulate 
Status = rejected 
V.O= young Chinese man
Time slot = 9.00 am
University = NYIT, Manhattan campus
Scanned passport and fingerprints
VO started looking at computer and then looked at me. He repeatedly did that  3 to 4 times. Then he asked 2 questions only. 
First Question = Why did you apply to this course? 
Answer = I have previously done BBA and now I'm planning to do MBA in order to polish my skills and expand my father's business in the global market. 
2nd = How did you find this university? 
Ans= I had previously done BBA from Lahore and now wish to study abroad for a global mindset, specially in a metropolitan city. So I searched for MBA program on Masters portal amd filtered my search for New York. (VO said Ok). I found a bunch of high ranked universities and then studied their ranking and course structure (VO said Ok as if it was enough) and this university matched my requirements. (Again Ok). Also,... (I was speaking in my flow but I realized that he had basically stopped me at this point. So I said Ok and stopped).
He asked me to go back and sit.
After some time I was taken into a seperate room where a Pakistani consular came and talked to me in Urdu.
I greeted him and he straight forward started like consider this a chance for yourself. I kept on agreeing with a smily face until he asked me which consultant did you use? I disagreed and told him that I had done everything by myself. However,  I have seeked some help from a friend as in discussions but nothing else. He continued this interogation for quite some time but my answers remained the same. He told me that I had matching profile with a lot of other candidates and that he has been dealing with them regularly. In fact, a lot of stidents with the same profile had come earlier and agreed that they used a consultant. I told him that a friend of mine has also come here with me and we have discussed things together if that is what you are looking for. But he remained insisting that there were many and that they've agreed to a consultant. I never agreed and he let me out and after some time, I got my passport back with white slip(214B).rejected.
Previously, my friend (whose appointment was at 8 15) was also interogated but for a longer duration than me. He claims that they showed him the exact location of the consultancy on computer screen. This did not happen with me nor he showed any other proof.
Also, I'd like some suggestions if I should go again with the same profile or change university and then apply for the next intake (January)? I'd really like to go in this intake but not sure if I'll be rejected again since I can't change my uni at this point!

I have my 2nd interview attempt next week. Got 1st attempt rejected in this may.
Everyone please pray for me.
And I wanted to ask that can I take my own statement of 10 to 15 days, would it be OK? Because they dont have any limit of days for statement,  plus would it be a problem if I take 2 statements, 1 mine and 2nd my mothers? 
Which statement do you recommend taking?
Is 
there a possibility that if I take my statement only, they would get a hint of me not returning? Rejection under 214b?
