Is there anyone in the group who can help me strengthen my case and make it more convincing for the visa officer when applying for the B1 visa?

Q1, 
What are the courses you’re going to study in first semester?
Ans, Cornerstone and two introductory courses. Fundamentals of management & marketing.

Ans, After graduation last year, I joined the xyz industry and I noticed a commonality amongst CEOs of top 10 companies operating here which was that 7 out 10 CEOs have all studied from the USA. And since I also want to make my career in Pakistani xyz industry, having studied in the US would increase my odds of a successful career in Pakistan Significantly.
Q2, When did you graduate? 
Ans, Last year in 2022, in the months on June/July

Right after graduation I joined xyz organisation’s headquarters for an internship for a period of 3 months and while still there I landed a job at the headquarters of abc and I have been working here since then.

Q7, (Pointing towards to amount on I20) VO asked about how I’ll arrange the funds needed for the second year of my master’s as the amount written on i20 is only for 1st year.
Ans, I already have the funds needed for second year of my masters as can be seen from my bank statements. My family has liquid funds of double the amount needed in I20 allowing for any unforeseen circumstances.
Q8, Please show me your bank statements
Ans, Passed the statements to the VO
Kept looking on the screen and then said that the US visa laws are very strict I’m sorry and then gave me a white slip.

Visa Approved in the third attempt!
Sharing this experience as a hope for many of you guys who will be appearing in their third attempt. I was refused twice in May and June from Islamabad Consulate. I applied again with the same profile after deferring my admission in the Karachi Consulate. 
I was refused first time around for showing myself self sponsoring my education even though I wasn't doing any job and my father had given me the funds back then too. It was a blunder from 
my side in the first attempt. 
2nd time around, the interview lasted only a minute, before visa officer refused me without asking any major questions. It was quite tough to gather the confidence for applying again after such an interview. 
Interview on 26th October.
University of Houston.
Master's in Industrial Engineering.
Karachi Consulate. 
Visa officer was an American Male in his 40's. 
When I reached the counter, we greeted each other and after that there was a pause of around 2-3 minutes without Vo asking me anything as he was going through my profile. 
Vo: Tell me about your parents.
My mother is a housewife. My father is an industrialist, we have have a business of manufacturing of adhesives and lubricants which my grandfather started 50 years back and after him his sons are managing it now and also the reason why I want to do industrial engineering, as I have to comeback and manage it afterwards.
Vo: In how many uni's did you apply?
I applied to a total of 5 uni's, out of which I got accepted into 4 of them. I applied to Clemson University where I got rejected from, and I got acceptances from UIC, USF, FSU and UOH where I'm going. Among them I choose University of Houston because Houston is a big industrial city and UOH has strongly industrial affiliated faculty. There are couple of professors at UOH, who take their students for industrial visits every week as part of their curriculum which enhance their practical knowledge which I'm looking for. 
I was quite animated at this moment and was making some hand gestures which annoyed the Vo. He asked me to stop doing that and answer him as I was talking to a friend. 
Vo: So you have one brother who is handling your family business? (I don't know where he got this from)
I told him that I have two elders brothers and they are also handling the business and well.
Vo: Have your brothers also studied from aboard?
No. They have got their education in Pakistan. 
Vo: Why do they want to send you abroad?
Told the visa officer how many brothers always wanted me to get the exposure and how they have always encouraged me to pursue education from abroad. I did an Aiesec internship in 2019, mentioned that too.
After this the Vo stopped asking questions and tried to make a decision but he was undecided at this time. I asked him I could help him with anything else but he said that he is not sure either way right now. I asked him should I tell him about why choose Industrial Engineering in the first place. He said no and that I would have read the website and would just pour it all out on him. 
I said no, just let me explain why I wanted to do Industrial Engineering.
Told him about Industrial Engineering and how USA is the pioneer of this field and that only a couple of uni's in germany and canada are offering this course with the same curriculum. Also mentioned that I have acceptances from Canada and Australia as well but I choose USA because of their quality etc.
Vo: Did your Visa also got rejected from Canada and Australia?
No. I didn't apply for Visa there, as I wanted to study Industrial Eng and my courses were different there.
Vo was still undecided trying to make a decision.
Vo: How big is your industry.
Told him about the number of people working there.
Vo: Okay, tell me about your time at Turkey.
Told him about Aiesec and how this internship gave me exposure and boosted my confidence etc. 
Eventually, the Vo handed me the blue slip. 
Vo: Enjoy your time in the USA.

Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world.

They also offer practicle courses, flexible education and cultural diversity further enhanced the educational experience. 
Vo. what are you going to study

vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.

This time, i have did everything on my own and i have received my i-20 and i want to take an Embassy appointment. I asked the consulatant can you just take an appointment for me, he is saying “I am Busy, i’ll do it when i have time”.  And he also isn’t giving me the credentials of the portal. 
Can you please let me know, for taking an embassy appointment, as i am in a refused 
category, do i need to use the same account of US Embassy portal by which my DS-160 was submitted earlier and i took my appointment?

VO: 
Hay Good Morning
Me: Good Morning
VO: Pass me your passport and I-20
Me: Sure Sir
VO: Put your right hand 4 finger on the scanner
Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

Me: Sir ,Is their anything wrong in my profile or what is the actual reason of refusal so that I can workout on it

Me: 3, UC Berkeley , Caltech and UT Austin.
VO: Ahn ,did you get admit from them ?
Me: UC Berkeley No ( because I was looking for fully funded offer ) ,UT Austin Yes with fully funded offer.
VO: Why Caltech ?
Me: There is number of reasons behind it 1) Pre-communication with my PhD supervisor, 2) Lab facilities in Caltech are advanced; 3) First university which are offering courses in 3D printing.
VO: why you look for 3D printing courses ?
Me: Because I'll be conducting my research with my supervisor on 3D print Concrete structures.

Me: Kind of , well sir actually I don't see any scope of 3DPC in my home country in next 20-25 years ,as this is highly advanced and emerging construction technology ,we still rely on traditional formwork construction, therefore , honestly speaking I'll be looking for a job in US or in Australia after having my PhD from Caltech in 3DPC .And...( VO asked ) .
VO: I see, this has to be an emerging and advance technology.You motivated me to study about it.chuckle..He called another guy on his back side and started discussing something while looking at my CV and I-20 .They were taking time ....
VO:Any travel history?
Me: Yes , Singapore, Japan , Turkey, UAE, Thailand and Malaysia etc.

Me: should I change my university for the 2nd attempt.
VO: it's not necessary, Caltech is best.
I was wondering and tried to get more Infos from there but couldn't succeed .
I still have the feelings that ties with country in this shouldn't be the case of visa  rejection.

READ THIS COMPLETELY IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO WASTE YOUR $$$ AND BE TRAPPED BY THESE SO-CALLED CONSULTANTS
All this started back in October 2022.
Firstly, I decided to go USA for my further studies as an undergraduate student, I chose my desired university but as I was blank and didn't know about this group I got trapped by one of the consultants in Karachi
OceanMall Those who live in Karachi know about it, There's a similar agency by the name of Ocean. I went there and discussed my university they told me they are associated with them but later on they got back to their word when I paid out their upfront fee and they forced me to their Panel Unversities
After paying out 40k PKR upfront they shared with me a document that says you need to pay a further 600$ to us for your process which indicates that 2/3 University application fee, SOP, Motivation letter, Internal evaluation of your documents US standards, and attestation from notary public
When I asked about my desired university all their excuse was that I was being so specific about it, and when I paid them and asked them to add one more university in place of my desired uni they acknowledged me we would do it
So, when I 1st paid them 300$ half of the 600$ which was equivalent to 67k PKR back on that date they provided me a single admission letter by the end of Dec 2022, and when I inquired about my money where they spent they refused to keep the transparency with me about anything and further added that when we get the admission letter our job is done, we don't apply to more university until we need. 
when I told them I needed the admission letter from the remaining uni as well I was told this would take 1 or 2 months which I answered I had no issues with that I needed it yet after 1 month they asked me to send my English test to uni that's where I got to know all that time they have not done anything and when I inquired about the last one which they answered ""we are not getting replies by that uni"" when I was personally in touch with that uni I was shocked and utterly disappointed to see that lying wasn't a big deal for them
That's where I wasted my 5 months because of them
Secondly, When I was doing everything on my own I got an acceptance letter and I20 from the university but then again I got trapped by another consultant this time got to learn about that agents who work with different recruiters, and all directly don't apply directly but by through the channels
I got the offer letter from Texas A&M Corpus Christi and the agency asked me to pay the Initial enrollment fee which was $ 1,000 I paid that fee in May 2023 and now I'm chasing them to get my refund back
When I paid out the enrollment fee I was just waiting for the I20, but guess what I have been offered an admission letter but my documents were not submitted still to the university that is again I got to know by the University itself after 2.5 months and the intake also missed out
So now altogether my 4 Lac 6k PKR is stucked with these consultants
Right now at the start of October, I tried to trust another person who was vouched by my friend to take my case and started working on but the person has disappeared now for no reason this time I have not paid anything to that person but, my time YES
My main reason for sharing this experience with you all is that do your research and apply on your own these consultants and recruiters will just gonna waste your time and nothing else
They know how to trap the students by showing scholarship ads and all but in the end they will offer you the same thing which you can find on the university website
This group has everything that a student needs!!!!

Me: I don't know. Maybe i loose my confidence or due to bad circumstances.
VO: But you had to clearify from the last Visa officer that why she's refusing your Visa?
.......I was really confused at this question and didn't know what to answer.......
Than I simply replied that you (V officers) don't tell the actual reason to the candidates.
She started typing on computer and i still had a Hope that I've given my best full confidently so after typing she just gonna approve my Visa but when she put yellow slip in front of me than I was really shocked.

Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Good afternoon everybody!
I was refused in April 2023 (F1 Visa).
Now I have changed my university and would like to appear for the interview again.
Unfortunately, I am not able to secure the date before 21st August 2023.
I 
booked the appointment in 1st week of September, I then talked to my university's International department in this regard and they were more than happy to provide me late arrival approval letter in case of attending the orientation and classes online on the zoom.
I consented and they provided me the late arrival approval letter of 1 month (20/09/2023).
Now I want to know if I could not secure the early dates, would I be able to satisfy my Consular officer with that letter?
Anyone with the same experience got their visa approved?
Please step forward and help me in this regard, I would be more than grateful to get assisted.
Thanks and Jazak Allah.

Visa refused (weak ties to home country)
Responses:
Why this university 
There are a couple of reasons for choosing this uni, it is offering me modules like international political economy that no other college in my list offered which directly aligns with my future plans. 
Other than that its location was a major attraction for me, as depaul is in center of Chicago, chicago is very diversified hence I can gain alot of cultural exposure which will further bolster my education.
Lastly, it gave me a generous amount of scholarship
Who is sponsoring you?
My father, what does he do(told)
How many employees in his company?
25-30 
What other schools did you apply to?
I applied top liberal arts schools in uk&usa.
Why did you choose this uni over them?
It had a better sub courses, and offered me more scholarship. 
Can anyone tell me where did I go wrong?

He was insisting that I must have to tell him that where university got funding to give me salary. He said your visa is refused and asked me to send him documents for further administration procedure. He said we will send you email then you can send us your passport by post later.

Hi everyone 
On 4th April my f1 visa was refused in US embassy but now I got another appointment for 3rd August 
I need help in one of my question for interview. 
I have applied at Illinois State University for nutrition psychology 
Need help to upgrade and arrange my answer of this question.
Q- 
Why USA? 
A- 
 Well, as everyone knows US ranks at no . 1 for having best education system and new research methods.Illinois State University is also providing American certified degrees which will help me to establish my career here more successful as there are not many experts in this field in my country and we need them.. According to Education Quality and Technology, America is far better than any other country because Germany is also offering research based studies and my field is all about research and survey based in which I’m interested but because of language barrier I can not express  myself there but in US it will be easier for me to communicate and learn.I also had a choice for UK but in UK There’s no multicultural environment.

Visa Approved in the third attempt!
Sharing this experience as a hope for many of you guys who will be appearing in their third attempt. I was refused twice in May and June from Islamabad Consulate. I applied again with the same profile after deferring my admission in the Karachi Consulate. 
I was refused first time around for showing myself self sponsoring my education even though I wasn't doing any job and my father had given me the funds back then too. It was a blunder from 
my side in the first attempt. 
2nd time around, the interview lasted only a minute, before visa officer refused me without asking any major questions. It was quite tough to gather the confidence for applying again after such an interview. 
Interview on 26th October.
University of Houston.
Master's in Industrial Engineering.
Karachi Consulate. 
Visa officer was an American Male in his 40's. 
When I reached the counter, we greeted each other and after that there was a pause of around 2-3 minutes without Vo asking me anything as he was going through my profile. 
Vo: Tell me about your parents.
My mother is a housewife. My father is an industrialist, we have have a business of manufacturing of adhesives and lubricants which my grandfather started 50 years back and after him his sons are managing it now and also the reason why I want to do industrial engineering, as I have to comeback and manage it afterwards.
Vo: In how many uni's did you apply?
I applied to a total of 5 uni's, out of which I got accepted into 4 of them. I applied to Clemson University where I got rejected from, and I got acceptances from UIC, USF, FSU and UOH where I'm going. Among them I choose University of Houston because Houston is a big industrial city and UOH has strongly industrial affiliated faculty. There are couple of professors at UOH, who take their students for industrial visits every week as part of their curriculum which enhance their practical knowledge which I'm looking for. 
I was quite animated at this moment and was making some hand gestures which annoyed the Vo. He asked me to stop doing that and answer him as I was talking to a friend. 
Vo: So you have one brother who is handling your family business? (I don't know where he got this from)
I told him that I have two elders brothers and they are also handling the business and well.
Vo: Have your brothers also studied from aboard?
No. They have got their education in Pakistan. 
Vo: Why do they want to send you abroad?
Told the visa officer how many brothers always wanted me to get the exposure and how they have always encouraged me to pursue education from abroad. I did an Aiesec internship in 2019, mentioned that too.
After this the Vo stopped asking questions and tried to make a decision but he was undecided at this time. I asked him I could help him with anything else but he said that he is not sure either way right now. I asked him should I tell him about why choose Industrial Engineering in the first place. He said no and that I would have read the website and would just pour it all out on him. 
I said no, just let me explain why I wanted to do Industrial Engineering.
Told him about Industrial Engineering and how USA is the pioneer of this field and that only a couple of uni's in germany and canada are offering this course with the same curriculum. Also mentioned that I have acceptances from Canada and Australia as well but I choose USA because of their quality etc.
Vo: Did your Visa also got rejected from Canada and Australia?
No. I didn't apply for Visa there, as I wanted to study Industrial Eng and my courses were different there.
Vo was still undecided trying to make a decision.
Vo: How big is your industry.
Told him about the number of people working there.
Vo: Okay, tell me about your time at Turkey.
Told him about Aiesec and how this internship gave me exposure and boosted my confidence etc. 
Eventually, the Vo handed me the blue slip. 
Vo: Enjoy your time in the USA.

Please Admin approve my post.
AOA to all of you.
I've been accepted by a professor for PhD program at the University of California, USA. I need your feedback on an important matter. The guidelines state that if you've studied in an English medium, you don't need an English test like IELTS or TOEFL. I reached out to the professor, who advised me to ask the graduate admission director, but I haven't received a response. I then contacted the graduate student affairs officer, who 
confirmed that I don't need to take the IELTS.
I'm a bit concerned about whether I should proceed without the test. The application deadline is December 1st, and need a 7-band score. Will this decision impact my application negatively? Your insights are much appreciated.

The atmosphere was very comfortable, and seeing that made my confidence boost. I spoke with the Visa Officer in a friendly manner, as if I was having a conversation with a friend. I had prepared long answers, but during the interview, I only spoke when necessary and avoided giving unnecessary details.
I want to tell all of you that feeling nervous is valid. It's okay to be nervous, and that's completely normal. Just don't stress out. I can't express how nervous and stressed I was, but once I was there, the environment made it easy, and I was able to manage my nervousness. One more important thing: hold on tightly to your faith in ALLAH. Our success is not because of our efforts alone, it's by the will of Allah. Get close to Him and put your trust in Him. Pray Tahajjud and Nawafil, and have faith in every aspect of your journey. They really helped me stay relaxed.
Additionally, this group also played a significant role in helping me. If your DS-160 form is filled out correctly, you have all the required tests and documents, then you're on the right track to get your visa.

Semester: Spring '24
Consulate: Karachi
Date: 21-08-23
VO 
was a middle-aged white man.
VO: Hi!
Me: Hello! good morning.
VO: Pass me these documents (I had my passport, I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation in my hand)
Me: Sure. There you go.
VO: (After looking at my documents) How old are you?
Me: I'm 23 years old.
VO: (After some time) so you are going to do your masters? 
Me: Yes sir!
VO: How did you get to know about this university?
Me: I came to know about SIUE from my FYP advisor. He has done researches and have publications in clean energy technologies. He has high regards for the work done by Dr. XYZ, he is a professor in the mechanical department of SIUE. Further upon my research I got to know that it is a notable institute in the Midwestern region. I also found the Uni to be affordable and upon completion of my admission process, I also recieved a scholarship of $8,000, which helped me finalising my decision to choose SIUE.
(VO hardly maintained any eye contact all this time)
VO: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Me: I have one younger brother.
VO: What do your parents do?
Me: My mother is a teacher at XYZ school and my father is a government employee in the ministry of XYZ as an Assistant Officer.
(He got a little confused at assistant officer, I had to tell him again and also mentioned my father's grade to him)
For a minute or so he kept typing something on his computer. And after a minute gave me my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation back.
At this point I was thinking that he didn't give me my passport back to me but then I saw him taking out a blue slip and eventually kept my mouth shut 
VO: There you go. (Not even a congratulations 
)
Me: Thank you. When can I have my passport back?
VO: You will receive an email in a week or so.
Me: Alright. Have a nice day. 
He only asked me 4 questions out of which I guess only 2 were relevant to my interview. He didn't ask for any single document other than my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation. I stayed confident, and maintained my tone but all of that wasn't even looked at 
. He already refused 2 F-1 candidates right infront of me and I was really scared but Alhumdulillah everything went far better than I expected. 
My question now is, how long will it take to get my passport back and when does the visa status on the portal gets updated??
Any questions are welcomed.

INTERVIEWER: INFAMOUS ASIAN
NO GRE
NO IELTS
GPA 2.86
Date: 8th June.
DISCLAIMER: My interview was very different from others so please don't take it as a guide as I don't want to mislead anyone.
After preparing myself for straight 20 days I went for an Interview, I was prepared for every kind of question, but there was something else written in my fate.
VO DID NOT ASK ANY COMMON QUESTIONS LIKE:
Why US? 
Why this university?
Rather he started like this
1) what are your daily responsibilities in your current job?
2) what does your father do? (Convinced with my one word ANSWER)
3) what are your plans after graduation? (Told him the names of 3 it companies name where I'm aiming to work at)
4) do you have any relatives? I said yes because I didn't want to lie
5) will you leave the current job? I said yes (btw I just joined that job 20 days ago)
Conclusion: All that time he was behaving as if the decision is already decided because he seemed too uninterested to hear my answers. It was like as if he was just completing a formality nothing else.
In a nutshell, for me US F1 VISA IS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON LUCK BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A HEC FUNDED PHD LEVEL GUY GETTING REJECTED WHOSE PROFILE WAS 4X STRONGER THAN MINE.
BUT GO WELL PREPARED AND BE CONFIDENT. I ALSO GREETED HIM IN A VERY LOUD VOICE. Also don't forget to pray and take your mother's prayers as they can do wonders.
GOODLUCK!
Thankyou

1st Attempt: Approved Alhumdulillah.
Interview was at 25th May Karachi Consulate.
Profile: BS from LUMS, going for MS Finance at University of Houston. Had Received out-of-station tuition waiver and additional scholarship as well. Have been working at Multinational bank for almost two years now.
VO: 
Pass me your passport and F1.
VO:  Why university of Houston?
ME: Firstly, the courses which they are offering, related to derivates trading and hedging and this is where my professional experience lies, as I have been working in the banking industry for over 2 years now, and I feel this degree would help me fill in the gaps in my skill set.
Also, one of my university professors had recommended this course and degree, as he had also completed his master’s from there.
Also, I have been following Professor XYZ, throughout my undergraduate phase, and read his publications on hedging techniques, so I thought it would be quite an experience to take live lectures from him.
VO: interesting!
VO: What is your job ?
ME: Told him about the general job description, routine tasks etc.
VO: Plans after graduation.
ME: Obviously, the plan is to complete my master’s with good GPA. And then to focus on my banking career, as employers in the Pakistani banking sectors tend to value those profiles and individuals who have done their education specifically from US Colleges. In fact, my current supervisor had done his Master’s from abroad, and at a very young age he is doing quite well. I have a similar objective, I believe this degree would help me to excel in the Pakistan banking sector, also that I have made good repo with my supervisor, he would be willing to hire me at a senior position, once I complete my master’s.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME:  it is my father.
VO: What is his profession?
ME: He is a banker as well, and currently working in one of the banks in UAE.
VO: Pass me the statement.
I handed over the statement to him.
VO: Your credentials are good, I am approving your visa. You will get your passport in a week.
For all the aspirants out here, the only thing matters is your level of confidence and communication skills. Regardless of the circumstances, and whatever is the outcome, just give your 100% and maintain eye-contact.

Embassy: Islamabad
Date: 12 May
Visa Status: Approved
I was a bit nervous and none of my answers went 100% smooth.
Here's how interview went.
VO: Hello(in very friendly tone)
Me: Hi
VO: (After taking my docs and entering them on PC) Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going to attend Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Cincinnati.
VO: (After a pause) Why did you choose this University?
Me: (I stuttered during this answer a bit) I am going because this university is aligned with my research interest.
VO: Why did you choose University of Cincinnati specifically?
Me: Because the lab facilities and faculty is suited to my research in additive manufacturing. It's the same research that I did in my bachelor's. (stuttered here too)
VO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father. (I stopped after saying this for around 20 secs and then started speaking again) He is manager at X and makes Y money through job Z money through rentals and some money thru real estate trading which I don't know how much is.
VO: Cograts. Enjoy your stay at united states.
Me: Thanks.
Thoughts? 
The visa doesn't mostly depend on the interview. The VO wasn't even listening to me with attention. It depends on your uni, course and any funding you have(I had $20k scholarship). My interview wasn't the best. Actually, I would say it was average or below average.
Almost all visas(5/5) got approved before me. Only 2 were refused, who went after me. Those 2 had genuine reasons to refuse. If I were VO, I would even refuse them(not cuz of hate lol but their case didn't seem strong on paper)
Suggestions?
1. Don't go for consultants. They apply for you at few unis which VOs are aware of. VOs don't even consider you in that case. They straight away reject you.
2. Take IELTS. Take GRE. Secure full/partial scholarship(you can easily get it). Then go for visa. You will get it InshAllah.

Visa experience:
Hi! I want to share my visa experience with you all. Although I just recently joined this group like a week ago but still it had a great impact on my preparation. Hence, I’m here to show my gratitude.
My interview was quite long and VO asked me back to back questions.
Date: 28th April 2023
Interview duration: Almost 5-6 mins
Status: Approved
(Literally he rejected back to back four F1 visa students before me)
Me: Good Morning Sir!
VO: Hi just a moment! 
Me: Sure take your time
VO: Staring at the screen and typing something
Me: I kept on standing quietly for a minute
VO: Please hand me your documents
Me: Here you go!
VO: So you’re going to US for studying?
Me: Yes! I’m going to US to do my Master’s in Biotechnology from UTSA
VO: How exactly did you hear about this university? 
Me: Okay so there’s an interesting take to it, when I was in my final year doing my research, I mainly cited Professor Clyde Phelix’s publications and research articles for my thesis. I even asked for his help when I was stuck at one point in my research, and he was of such great help through emails. It is now my dream to work in his lab and have him as my supervisor and continue my research.
VO: What research did you do?
Me: I explained him about my FYP in 3-4 lines
VO: Hmm sounds interesting! So do you have any relatives in US?
Me: No sir I don’t have any immediate relatives however, my father’s distant cousin lives in Maryland I think .. I ‘m not sure.
VO: Slightly laughed and said well but you’re going to Texas!
Me: Smiled in a shy manner and nodded yes
VO: So you’re gonna live in campus dorm?
Me: Oh yes absolutely! I really want to fully absorb the campus culture and experience the dorm life. 
VO: So you’ve done bachelors from here?
Me: Yes sir! I have done my bachelor’s in biological sciences from _____ university and my major was immunology
VO: When did you graduate?
Me: I recently graduated in February 2023. 
VO: The entire time he was looking at his screen and hardly maintained eye contact
Me: I actually graduated Summa cum Laude in my batch
VO: Still staring at the screen, and said so who’s funding you?
Me: So my father is sponsoring my education and living expenses
VO: What does he do?
Me: My dad is a businessman affiliated with the real estate. He owns a construction company. He’s constructing a commercial plaza and alongside he constructs houses and sells them.
VO: How many siblings do you have?
Me: I just have one younger brother and he’s nine years younger than I am.
VO: Kept typing vigorously and staring the screen.
Me: I do have bank statement and my transcripts with me in case you want to see?
VO: Yeah okay sure I’ll check It anyway.
Me: Hands him the documents
VO: Did you give any standardized tests?
Me: Yes sir I gave IELTS only, because GRE was waived off but I was fully prepared and actually intended to give it though! 
***Okay so now he did something weird and I was like what’s he doing***
VO: He raised my transcripts, bank statement and other documents in the air and turned around to show the documents to 3-4 people sitting behind him. 
Me: I kept standing quietly and kept observing
VO: He kept typing for about 2-3 mins! Those 3 minutes felt like 10 mins I swear
Me: Silently praying in my heart to Lord that pleaseeee after this much lengthy interview please just save me the hassle and give the blue approval slip to me already.
***After 3 mins he hands me back my i-20 and seriously says***
VO: Make sure to show this at the airport
Me: I understood his hint but waited for his approval
VO: Congratulations I’m approving your visa! Good luck with your research make sure you do come up with an innovative way to tackle your research problem. Best of luck for your future and do remember to collect your passport on time
Me: I passed a smile! Said my thanks to him and left.
Sorry for the long narration 
 it had to be done! Once again I’d like to thank this group for providing a platform and for helping me in my journey.

These questions are so simple but in a way its more difficult for those students who are feeling hesitation in front of visa officer.

Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

F1 Visa Interview Experience, 26th September 
Karachi Embassy  
1st Attempt, Approved and Issued 
Illinois Institute of Technology, LLM Spring semester 2024.
It 
was a smooth process from start to finish.
Vo: Good Morning, pass me your documents.
Me: Good morning, here.
Vo: Why you are going to the USA?
Me: I am going for my master's LLM from IIT.
Vo: How many universities you have applied to?
Me: I applied to 4 universities and got accepted to 3 of them with 25-50% scholarships, and one of them hasn't gotten back to me yet.
Vo: So you are going for a master's in science? (I think this was a trick to confuse me).
Me: No, I'm going for my master's in law since I did my undergrad in law.
Vo: When and where did you get your undergrad degree?
Me: From the University of London in 2021
Vo: Why don't you have a UK student visa stamp on your passport?
Me: I did my LLB via an affiliated institute in Karachi.
(During this time, she was checking my passport).
Vo: Have you ever traveled abroad?
Me: Yes, I've been to the UK and Saudi Arabia 
Vo: You got a scholarship and these are your family funds, right? (Pointing at my I20)
Me: Yes, (My total funds were more than the expenses listed on the I20).
Vo: OK, who is going to sponsor you?
Me: My father will be sponsoring me and explained all the details. 
Vo: Does your father have a visa?
Me: Yes, 
(I thought she was talking about the UK visa at this point, but she was asking about the US visa. Corrected myself and told her No).
Vo: What are your future plans?
Me: My plan is to come back and start my own practice here in international law. 
Vo: OK, I am approving your visa. You’ll get your passport within a week and here’s the slip.
These are a few tips I learned from my whole experience.
- Do your paperwork from filing your ds160 to the interview appointment. I made a slight mistake in my ds160 and changed my form before the interview. 
- Be confident during the interview, it matters a lot. They scrutinize the body language and attitude of the applicant. 
- If you're not sure, ask around in the group. I posted many times with my queries and asked members for help.
- Reach out to the universities repeatedly for your concerns, they’ll help you in every way possible.
- Watch Argo Visa Interviews, they are so helpful and accurate. 
- Take this interview as a normal interview. It’s a normal process. Usually I overthink things, but the day before the interview I stopped myself from reading interview posts and anything related to it. It eased my nerves a lot. I was way more relaxed than my family members lol.
- And the most important thing is to pray and make lots of dua. InshaAllah you’ll be fine.

F1 status: Approved Alhamdulilah MashaAllah 
Date: 24th June 2023
Interview time: 9:15am
Actual interview: 11:45am 
Karachi Consulate 
Although there were few minor mishaps that happened too that day but i tried to remain calm and relaxed throughout and managed to convince the VO to approve my visa Alhamdulilah. At first i wasn’t given any token number and when i realized that i have no token number, i went back and got token number of much later time 
 Next, i was instructed to bring another passport size photo from the nearest studio as early as possible as my current picture wasn’t acceptable since i was wearing a hijab and some sides were not visible (according to them). Anyways, i went to the nearest studio (Dosani’s) and came back after an hour. And waited half an hour more to have my interview. 
I greeted him, he ignored and had a straight bezaar face. VO was a male. He asked me to pass my documents. I did. 
VO: So why are you going to US
Me: To pursue dual Masters in public informatics and urban planning from Rutgers University, New Jersey.
VO: Hold on, whats public informatics? Is it related to public health? 
Me: No its not related to public health, its related to data analytics. I tried explaining him the relevancy of this field with my field and how it aligns with my bachelors degree. He was listening me carefully and even typed it on his computer and i think read it online too on Rutgers website. I even mentioned few data related courses like GIS, Envi, python and he was like now whats GIS? So I explained him in detail about that too. 
VO: Okay so i see you have also gotten a 60% scholarship. How are you managing remaining funds? 
Me: My family is going to sponsor my education; that includes my father and two brothers. 
VO raised his eyebrows and looked at me.
I gave him my father’s background and of my brothers background. He asked me to pass their financial documents. He carefully saw each of those documents and verified the amount that i was stating while telling him about my father and brothers earnings and savings. I also told him about couple of investment lands that we own and their worth in dollars. 
Vo: Whats the status of your brothers in US?
Me: One of them is on H1B and another one has just started his professional hybrid masters program. 
Vo: Okay and what are your future plans? 
Me: Told
By that time he already took out a paper which i didn’t see which color that was. But he seemed satisfied and was smiling. 
Me: Last but not the least, one interesting fact is that when i first visited USA back in 2020, I got the chance to explore the campus of Rutgers New Brunswick, so this was also one of the reasons of selecting Rutgers apart from scholarship and its outstanding reputation. I am familiar with the place and have explored the campus for days. 
Vo: Thats wonderful. Congratulations i am approving your Visa. Im keeping your passport. Thankyou. Bye bye 
Me: Thankyou so much. Have a nice day. 
My advice: Be confident and well prepared. And dont be hideous at all. They already know everything about you and I could’ve said something else on the question of my brothers status but i chose to be honest and straightforward. 
Best of luck to everyone. Prayers for all. 
Allahumma Barik

VO: Any realtives or friends in the US?

me: mother and siblings

VO: congratulations your visa has been approved you can collect your passport on next Friday.
I might have missed some of the qs but the interview lasted for about 5 minutes. The VO seemed already annoyed and he had rejected 2 people infront of me and was not in a good mood. He was constantly looking at the computer screen. After each question there was a break a long one aswell. I couldn't catch anything from his expressions. I prepared myself as much as I could but it was mostly because of my prayers and faith in Allah. I would advise everyone to do the same. First prepare yourself fully and then trust Allah's plan. I felt very bad for the refused people but there's a reason to HIS plan. 
Any questions are welcome.

Me: ok thank you.
THE TRICK IS to be Confident and natural like these questions don’t even matter and don’t get stuck while speaking. Try to stay to the point and not give a comeplete story for every answer you give.
My Experience: I came alone to a place near the embassy to stay. At 1 am I realized My mother hadn’t signed my I-20 I forgot to tell her to sign it.
My friend photostated my I-20 from the call center I worked at and delivered it to my home. 
At 2 am my parents left from Peshawar to give me the signed form. Then they asked to drop me off even tho it was just 5:30, I agreed and found out The roads were blocked and we had to take a long route.
I found out no InDriver no careem no Uber were available at the time. So it was a miracle my family came to drop me off. 
If I hadn’t forgotten to sign my form, my family wouldn’t have had come to drop me off and there’s a chance I would have messed things up 
But Thanks to Allah almighty things worked out.
Moral of the story if it’s written for you it will happen if it’s not Allah has better plans for you. Try try again
Best of Luck everyone May Allah bless us All

Masters in Engineering Management
Interview date: 16 June 2023
Time: 8:00 AM
VO  was a lady in her early 30’s
Me: Hey! Good Morning Mam
VO: Good Morning, How are you?
Me: I am Fine, what about you?
VO: I am fine too. Thanks for asking. Pass me your documents.
Me: Sure.
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going to pursue my Masters degree in Engineering management from XYZ University.
VO: Which degree have you recently completed?
Me: I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from XYZ University in karachi.
VO: When did you graduated?
Me: I graduated in October 2022.
*She was constantly typing on computer, there was 5-6 seconds gap after this question, so I started telling her that when I was in USA  in 2021, so I visited this university physically and met the ABC professor and ABC Professor, they both cooperate with me so much, and Dr. ABC gave me whole university tour, and also show me the research facility of Engineering management including all labs.*
VO: You were on your pleasure trip so why did you go to this city? As it is not a tourist city. Did you just go to specially visit this university?
Me: No no, I was on tour of Las vegas, los angeles and Orlando but in last I visited this city because my cousin live just 30 minutes away from this city, and he was giving me tour of beaches and several museums, during that I saw this university and planned to visit it on other day. My cousin is also a F1 student, studying in XYZ University.
VO: Oh Ok! So you were visiting your cousin in that city.
Me: Yes Mam.
VO: In how many universities did you applied?
Me: I just applied in this university, because I have physically visited this university so I was well aware of this university and city. As my CGPA is …….., so you know there are few better universities where we could apply.
VO: *nodded her head* Yes, you are right.
Me: As there is no consultant involved in my case, all I have done by my own after doing proper research between few universities. Rather than wasting my money and time by applying to several universities, I just focused on few universities and finalized this one. I also got a scholarship of ……… amount.
VO: You have done a good job! So what’s your plan to do ahead, I mean in which sector do you want to do certifications or job?
Me: I want to go towards the sustainable energy sector, as my FYP was also regarding that so I have much information on sustainable energy. 
*I explain here my FYP in few lines*
VO: Interesting. So tell me about your masters degree that is there just generally engineering management or you have to take any selective sub-field in that?
Me: In this university, there are several sub-field under engineering management, such as robotics and automation, supply chain management, civil engineering focus, Industrial Engineering focus, Mechanical engineering focus and chemical engineering focus.
VO: So, what you are going to pick?
Me: I will choose mechanical engineering focus, as my bachelors is in same field so I have a vast knowledge of it.
VO: Right! Why did you want to do masters degree?
Me: If I would be just having bachelors degree so it would be having not that much worth. If I want to get promoted to higher level so I must have a masters degree too. Well, I selected this program rather than selecting same program as my bachelors, the main reason is that if you want to go to management level post like to the highest post like CEO, so you must have management degree. What mostly engineers do is that they pursue simple MBA for this reason, and I think that if I would be doing MBA which is a business degree, after my BE Mechanical, so it would be like that I am throwing my technical field degree in dust bin. Therefore, I choose this program which is combination of management and engineering fields.
VO: Ok, right! What are you doing right now like are you studying any course or doing any job or something else?
Me: I am currently working in XYZ company as a mechanical engineer, you may see in my application that I have written NO in job section because when I booked my appointment so till then I was unemployed, but after 2 days of it I got a call from my CEO for vacant position of mechanical engineer. This is the same company where I had done my 2 months internship in month of December and January, as I was having a good working relation with my CEO so I asked him during my last days of internship that if there would be any vacancy of engineer post so he must let me know. I’ll be going on study leave, and it has been granted to me along with surety that when I will be back so I will be promoted to XYZ post due to my masters in engineering management. Do you want to see those letters?
VO: No, I don’t want to see anything, just you tell me verbally, its ok.
*she was constantly typing, so to gain her attention I start talking about my Exchange program trip to USA in 2016, where we were guest of University of Toledo, after hearing this she start talking to me again*
VO: So how long was your trip?
Me: It was just for 15 to 16 days, and I also got just 20 days visa for it. You may see it in my passport.
VO: Yeah, most of the time for exchange program, only limited time visa is granted. So, when you were in that city where you are going to do masters, what did you like there and what did you didn’t like?
Me: I love it, the calmness, its nature and the people are so much caring and lovely. There is not a single thing which I could say that I didn’t like. 
VO: Not a single thing! There must be anything that you may have thought that this shouldn’t be like this?
Me: No mam, seriously, there is not a single thing like that. That whole city is amazing.
VO: Good. Ok! (She start smiling ) So I am approving you visa. Good luck for your trip to USA. Hope you will like it. Well, we are also conducting pre-departure orientation ( she gave me blue slip along with the orientation pamphlet), I would suggest you to register yourself and must attend this, it would be helpful. 
Me: Sure Mam, I will definitely come to attend this. Thank you so much.
Me: Bye mam, have a nice day.
Vo: Thank you, you too.

Date: 26 September
Embassy: Islamabad
Status: approved (I had a prior refusal in 2022 in B2)
Appointment time: 7:45
The 
embassy was quite empty when I arrived and I believe I was the 4th or 5th person in the interview when counters opened.
Visa officer was a young American lady and pretty nice and friendly.
VO: Good morning! How are you doing?
Me: I am fine thank you for asking. How are you?
VO: I’m good. Why are you going to US?
Me: I’m going there to pursue my masters in business analytics from the University of Central Oklahoma.
Me: alright! Why did you choose this uni?
Me: Actually my sister referred this university to me initially since she is already studying in the US and then I researched about it from my end as well. I found the coursework to align quite well with my future goals because I plan to join the banking sector of here as a business analyst and there was this specific course of predictive analytics I really wanted to study since it is quite useful in the banking sector and UCO offered it so I went with it and everything seemed good. I also scored a partial scholarship.
VO: Ok so two of your sisters study over there?
Me: No my elder sister is studying over there only.
VO: And what is she studying over there?
Me: she is doing her associate in nursing.
VO: who is sponsoring her?
Me: my father.
VO: so he is also going to sponsor you right?
Me: Yes entirely

VO: which bank?
Me: Bank of Punjab, it’s a government bank.
VO: what is his exact grade?
Me: Executive vice president.
VO: Nice. Do you have any travel history?
Me: Yes I went to Saudi Arabia in 2016 with my entire family and recently went to UAE in December 2022.
VO: Great. Do you know anyone else in the US?
Me: not from my fast family but my brother in law is also over there.
VO: I see. (Spent almost 30 seconds typing something on the computer and then came the final verdict)
VO: congratulations your visa has been approved. Thank you for coming. You will receive your passport in almost a week. Have a nice day.
Me: Thank you so much. Have a nice day!
The overall time of interview was 4-5 mins I think at max and the entire time, I tried my best to stay confident and keep a nice smile on my face. The officer was quite understanding and took interest in what I said. Also, main thing is surprisingly all 3 people before me and 2 people after me got their visa accepted.
This group honestly helped me a lot in the preparation and even though I was quite nervous till the end (because I had a few weak things in my case; my sister was studying in the US, her daughter was born there and is a US national, my entire family already has valid visas, I have been previously refused), I believe I aced the interview. 
Also, ARGO Visa’s Youtube channel is honestly very very useful.

Thanks.
Important points you should consider before applying for the F1 visa.
1)If you going for studies in the USA then you have to do the entire process without the support of any consultant, otherwise, your visa will be rejected.
2)You have to be very confident while you are communicating with the visa officer.
3) Your dress matters a lot, always prefer to wear simple and dark-colored clothes for the visa interview.
4)Always try to work on your grooming if you are planning for the visa interview (Beard, Hair Cut, Hair Colour, and Clean Shave) Everything should be up to date.
5) Try to keep a smile on your face while giving the interview.
6) If you do not know how to apply to a US university or even how to apply for a visa then you have to select the other country, USA is not the right place for you. Your input really matters.
7) Stop giving answers in YES or NO (Your answer should be at least one line).
Thank you so much Rana Ibrar and Mahwish Moazzam for your continuous effort and support. That was impossible without your assistance. God Bless you.

 PLEASE APPROVED
Hello everyone I hope you guys doing well I just want to confirm few things before my interview... Need your suggestions seniors!!! 
1) My marksheets are not attested from HEC, my university didn't ask for it, is it necessary for visa? I completed intermediate 
2) 
What if the amount we show in a bank statement for i-20 is taken out from the account and put it back  before interview date..so is it fine? My father is a business man and that's why he never hold cash for a long time in his account. 
3) can I use the same bank statement which I used to receive i-20.

VO: Ok so, you can take these documents back and we've approved your visa. (Passed me the blue slip while smiling)
Me: thank you. (Smiled back)
VO: Enjoy your stay with your family. (Said happily)
( For most of the time, she kept looking and typing at the screen. Didn't look at me for longer than a second or two during each of my answers. Also my answers were brief and to the point so she didn't have to look for long either.
I kept an eye contact during the whole interview and also maintained a bit smile throughout my interview though it went quite long and I had to wait a lot in between too.
I had a plus point of already having a visit visa so I used that in start while answering the question of why I chose that uni. As I heard that the VO may have not gone through all your data so you should convey them such info yourself.
Though my answers were not in detail but i did prepare myself for any type of detail. I made a list of all possible questions and prepared the detailed answers then filtered out the important information only.  Saved the detail for only the case if they themselves ask me to go into.
You should definitely have all the information about the university you're applying to. They should not get the idea that you've selected a university without doing any proper research)

My sponsor is xyz and he has a business based in pakistan. (Gave some details of his business here to avoid usual follow up questions regarding sponsor. 
VO: Your visa is approved. 
The interview was of one minute at max. I had an upper hand because of being a issued a tourist visa earlier but most people were getting accepted that day. 
A few pointers for people who would be applying:
- Aim for universities that have a QS ranking of under 500. 
- Apply to multiple universities (3-5) as it shows the student's interest in studying. 
- Try applying to a field that is related to your current work experience or undergraduate degree. 
All they really see is the student's authenticity and his ability to come back after studies. If they have any doubt about the student staying there or going to earn money, they will reject your visa. 
All the best, may Allah make the process easy for everyone.

FALL 2024 USA BACHELORS STUDENT and future BS applicants
So my visa got approved yesterday for bachelors in CS – The University of Southern Mississippi (100% tuition fee scholarship)
A lot of people have been asking me about how I received multiple scholarships for BS programs within the United states.
Three reasons
1- GPA (1088/1100 in matric | 4 As in A’ levels)
2- SAT (1360/1600- 700/800 in Math 660/800 in English)
3- Extra co-curricular activities (President of debating and declamation club, led an NGO of interfaith abuse and violence, tree plantation/ration packages/water filtration plant in Cholistan drives, internships and blah blah)
So I’ll lay out the process for Fall 2024, if you want to receive a 100% scholarship and more.
I currently have a 110% scholarship from USM (100% rn. will get additional 4k in July), 100% from Stetson University, Presidential award from Siena College and Founders Scholarship from Ferris State University.
Step 1: START EARLY
I cannot emphasize how much starting early is important in order to receive a scholarship. If you’re going for Fall 2024 then you should start your prep this summer.
I, as a fall 2023 applicant, took my SAT in August 2022. I applied to all of the universities that offer full scholarships BEFORE OCTOBER 1, 2022. 
Yes. A year early. A lot of universities have strictly mentioned on their websites that their scholarship will be given to students who apply before a specific date. It’s usually October 1.
There are three options you can apply:
 
ED (Early Decision):
 It is a binding decision. If you get into that university, you are legally bound to go to that university. Higher acceptance ratio
EA (Early Action):
You apply early. Deadlines around a year before the start of the semester. It is non-binding. High acceptance ratio. Less competitive. More chances of hefty scholarships
RD or Rolling (Regular Decision):
 Deadlines around 3-6 months before the start of semester
Step 2: SAT
A v basic thing: NO SAT = NO 100% SCHOLARSHIP (unless you’re able to prove you’re Einstein ki aulad and shit). Even though the option of going SAT optional exists, there are hardly any universities that offer handsome scholarships to SAT optional students.
The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It’s also used by universities in Pakistan like LUMS, IBA, NUST, etc. Based on a bit of advanced English and almost matric wali maths but theoretical so cramming won’t help.
1500+: you have a good chance for Ivy league and other top 25 universities
1450+: Merit based full rides and 100% scholarships
1360+: 100%+ scholarships
See? A lot of universities offer merit based scholarships. Meaning they don’t care what you did in your school, they just want your GPA and SAT score.
Step 3: Reach out and research
It’s never a shame to ask queries that can help you. Join groups on Facebook like this one and COALI. Post your queries. Ask for help. People are always willing to help.
Research about universities and scholarships. Go to Reddit r/intl2usa and check it all out. Check which universities offer aid to international students. CSS or IFSAA. Check for fee waivers. Everything is available. Just reach out and research.
Step 4: Apply
Use commonapp or scoir to apply.
Step 5: Write essays and stuff
A lot of universities require you to write essays that reflect what you are. Hire a counsellor if you have money (4-8 lakhs) or use CHATGPT or freelancers to write your essays if you’re not exceptional at descriptive writing
Attaching a sample below that I wrote for Villanova University
Villanova University
Question:
St. Augustine states that well-being is “not concerned with myself alone, but with my neighbor’s good as well.”  How have you advocated for equity and justice in your communities? 250 words
Answer draft:
“He is a Shiite; do not eat with him”. 
I was unable to conceal my shock and disbelief as I struggled to comprehend and process the ""advice"" I had just heard. I did not interact with the ""reliable advisor"" at the time, but later, I kept contemplating about what had happened to me and my friend. This was the first time I realized how prevalent sectarian and interfaith prejudice and hatred was in the community around me, and how frequently minorities were subjected to such horrific discrimination, hate, and prejudice.
The more people I spoke to and read about, the more heinous the world seemed to me. Because I was unable to stomach the internalized hatred that my society had so casually instilled in itself.  My moral conscience had always prohibited me from treating anyone wrongfully because of their ideologies, faith or race. I was aware that this was wrong and that I needed to take action. I collaborated with the ""Hifz-o-Amaan"" Foundation, an NGO working to reduce sectarian and interfaith violence and injustices. As the campus ambassador, I promoted tolerance and raised awareness regarding religious extremism by arranging events with minority groups, visiting churches on Christmas Day to exchange gifts, and hosting joint activities with them. I was aware that spreading awareness and love, one person at a time, may treat social diseases like this of hatred and prejudice because indeed, it is the people are that constitute society.
Step 6: Maintain liaison
Keep a daily check at your mail. Universities will ask for additional documentations and stuff. Be ready to reply to them within one day.
Baqi duaen kru boss. Allah hi krta hai sab. Sab ussi ne krna hai. Humari tau bss koshish hi hai. Result dena uska kaam hai.

Interviewer: A lady
PhD Civil Engineering, University of Kansas.
Morning Mam,
VO: 
Morning
Questions:
What's University name in US? 
KU
What's your Major? 
Civil Engineering
Why were you in China? 
Study
Was that on scholarship? 
Yes
Had a same major in China?
Yes
Which University in China? 
Told
What's your proposed research in US? 
Told
So you have an assistantship, who's is your supervisor? 
I told her the name of my supervisor, she searched the internet and she asked me to spell it because she couldn't find it.  Then I passed her the CV of my supervisor and when she saw his profile, she searched on the internet again.  After typing a few seconds, she told me that, ""I'm approving your visa."" Congratulations.
#Tips
: Be confident and answer to the point, no need to explain. 
#Experience
: If you are having travel history and an assistantship then the interview is just a formality.
#Feeling
: I was feeling excited but once the shuttle bus driver and some other workers saw the ""approval slip"" in my hand they asked for ""Methai"".  I ignored them once but they kept asking for methai which was very annoying.  They have no ethics.  I spent 4 years in China and this was my second day in Pakistan after 4 years.  I saw many beggars on Islamabad road's and even in the embassy office today.

Got my F1 visa approved on my second attempt today alhamdulillah.
First visa attempt:
https://m.facebook.com/groups/1541028822851688/permalink/3483379868616564/?mibextid=Nif5oz
Second attempt:
I stumbled a lot in reply to the first question and was sure that the visa officer would reject me again but it didn't happen this time. 
I believe it was because I answered all questions in relation to how the degree would help me in Pakistan.
Here's how the second attempt went:
Visa officer: What school are you going to?
Me: xyz school (not mentioning some details for anonymity) for a master's degree in business analytics.
VO: Why are you going to this school?
Me: I'm going to this school because the program they offer teaches information in the context of business first. As I plan to start my own business after coming back, a degree from this school would help my plans a lot. (Stuttered a lot and got confused and barely gave a coherent response but this was the gist of it).
VO: You only applied to this school?
Me: Yes. I was going to apply to abc school too but I was procrastinating and then I ended up getting accepted in xyz school. It was my first choice anyway so I didn't apply to the second school.
VO: Why did you choose this degree at xyz school?
Me: Like I mentioned previously, I plan to start my own data analytics business after coming back and because this degree teaches skills in the context of business, that's why I am choosing this degree.
VO: What business would you like to start?
Me: I have been working for x type of companies for the last 5 years. I plan to start my own company in this field.
VO: How did you find out about this school? Not many Pakistani students apply here.
Me: I spend a lot of time on a data science community online and I saw an ad in that community of the university. I researched the program and it appeared to be aligned with my interests so I chose to apply here.
VO: How will you sponsor your studies?
Me: I have a scholarship of x amount. The rest is through self-finance. I have been making a salary of x per month which I've saved. I'll use that to pay for my degree.
VO: Can I see your bank statements?
Me: (passed my statements) Btw my brother has also agreed to sponsor me in case I run into any deficit.
VO: What does your brother do?
Me: He works in the data science field and lives in Saudi Arabia.
VO: Do you have any relatives in US?
Me: Yes, my brother lives in Chicago. 
VO: Is he an immigrant? What does he do?
Me: No, he's not an immigrant. He's an engineer at x company.
VO: Your visa is approved.
I had to remove a few details but I'm fairly certain that the reason why I got a visa this time was because I answered a few times why this degree would help my future plans. I have given a brief summary in my answers but I know that I talked about my future business at least 3-4 times and how this degree will help me start that business.
Some tips:
1. When the VO asks you why you want to go for this university, try to answer the question in a way that ties back to your plans and how this school will help you achieve the plans. Your answer should mention that this school will help you gain __ skills which will help you do __ when you come back to Pakistan. This school is the best option of gaining __ skills hence why you chose it.
Last time, I gave a generic answer (this university has a good ranking, the program teaches machine learning etc etc). The VO didn't even listen to my full answer.
2. Stumbling in the beginning thankfully didn't hurt my chances. I was stuck quite badly in the first answer and thought for sure the VO will have a bad impression but that didn't happen, so if this happens to you, don't lose your cool and try to answer the rest of the questions as confidently as you can.
3. In my DS 160, in the section where you're supposed to explain if you have gotten any rejections in the past, I wrote a whole essay.
I mentioned how I had been sick at my last attempt and that affected the way I answered my questions. I mentioned that I failed to clarify my sponsorship and didn't explain why I had resigned from my job so that got me rejected. I gave all explanations in that essay. 
I don't know if it helped me or not but the VO this time asked me no questions about my first rejection so maybe it did?
4. If the VO asks you if there's anything new about your application this time after your first rejection, always say yes and try to give information you didn't give them the first time around.
Watch Argo Visa and Mandy's videos on YouTube and try to have a planned strategy before your interview.

I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

My advise for everyone, just be confident and be an active speaker. If they ask you a question, dont just answer them in a single word but start talking like ur having a normal conversation. They literally listen to your jargon even if it makes no sense lol. My sister lives in USA, but they didnt even ask me about her neither they asked for any other documents. 
Ek din pehle kisi dawat mai chale jaana taake uncles aise personal sawal tumse puche so that u know exactly what to answer. Thats exactly what i did lmao. 
Best of luck everyone.

Interview date = 15 Aug
Status = approved 
V.O= long beard man
Time slot = 10.30 am
First Question = how many admits you got
Answer = i got admission in 3 out of 4 universities in which i applied. Unfortunately wasn’t able to make it to university of rochester. Also named the universities and their business schools in which i got admit
2nd = why this xyz university 
Ans= Told MSBA at xyz is ranked among top 100 MsBa programs in the world according to Qs rankings. Also told in detail about the diversity of curriculum 
3rd= how many brothers you have
Ans = told 1 and also about his profession
4Th= who is financing you
Ans= told i have got scholarship of about 5K and have personal savings of around 8k and the rest of cost which is almost 43 k is going to be paid by my father. 
He asked about his business and i gave him the details 
5th= he asked me about my mother’s sister who lives in US
Ans= i told him that i have no immediate relative but about other relatives I already had mentioned in my Ds-160. He didn’t bother about it because she lives in different state than the state in which I have got acceptance..
Conclusion = 
Before the start of interview i had got the confidence that I would get visa because VO gave quite time to a student before me and listened him comprehensively before rejecting his visa so i got the feeling that if he gives me that chance i ll have the chances to get the visa. No doubt it is game of luck . And also the VO who is quite young was also giving alot of opportunity to speak . Women VO had more interviews from non-F1 categories and she put most of these cases to administration processing

Background info: I had two prior B1/B2 rejections 3-4 years ago.
I will list down as many questions as I remember. I apologize in advance, but I was so nervous and it was quite lengthy so I don’t recall all questions and answers, or the order in which I was asked. This post is very, very long.

---
VO: Please pass your documents. (She spent a lot of time looking at her screen and my I20.)
VO: Why the US?
(I feel like I fumbled here but I just answered how the US is the best at research and my program and that’s why I want to pursue my masters there at (my uni))
VO: Why (this uni)? (it’s in the top 20 of my grad program, btw)
(I gave my reasons and I also mentioned that I talked to current students and alumni.)
VO: How many people did you talk to?
(I told her about the students I talked to and the staff at uni I talked to, as well as the information seminars I attended.)
VO: Why this course?
(I talked about my major, its application in research, and how im interested in pursuing a career in this field.)
VO: What kind of research?
(I told her the kind of diseases im interested in studying.)
VO: What diseases specifically?
(I told her about the two diseases im interested in researching that are also prevalent in my community.)
[P.S: I had experience managing these diseases as a doctor.]
VO: Where do you work currently?
(I told her my job title in clinical research and my work place)
VO: What do you do in your job exactly?
(I elaborated on my duties in my current job.)
VO: How will this course help you? What kind of career can you have?
(I elaborated on how research is something ive already been involved in since my undergrad years and im continuing that. And I told her the several different jobs I can get here in Pakistan. And how it’s a step up from my current work and job title.)
VO: Where would you find these jobs here (in Pakistan)?
(I told her about the place I want to work at in my city and the person there im interested in working with. I also mentioned my current workplace.)
VO: So you’re a medical doctor?
Me: Yes
VO: When did you graduate?
Me: three years ago
VO: Where did you graduate from?
(I told her my university name.)
VO: Where is this college?
Me: Here in ___ (my city) right next to the ____________hospital.
VO: What did you do since?
(I talked about my jobs since graduating. My intern year and then of course my current job.)
VO: Whos sponsoring you?
Me: My uncle and aunt and a Dean’s scholarship.
(I told her the names of my sponsors, and how the scholarship was merit based.)
VO: What do they do?
(I told her each of their job titles and place of work)
VO: (Again confirmed my uncle’s workplace).
Me: Yes.
(She was typing a lot and looking at something on her screen while I talked about my sponsors)
VO: Do you have any financial documents of your uncle and aunt. Anything I can see now?
Me: Yes, I have their bank statements and affidavit of financial support. Would that be fine?
VO: Yes.
Me: Sorry they have these post-it/tags on them
VO: That’s fine.
Me: Okay here you go. (I also ended up giving both their passport copies)
VO: Oh so theyre separate people, not married to each other?
Me: Oh no no, theyre both separate people, not related.
VO: Where do they live?
Me: My uncle lives here in (my city) at ____ and my aunt lives in ____ (abroad, not US)
VO: (She sifted through everything; the bank statements, my I20, and was carefully reading even the affidavit. I should highlight here that I assume my last two rejections for the B1/B2 visa were because of my finances, which is probably why she was carefully reading everything in my case. Just my opinion.)
VO: Alright I see you have enough for one academic year. What about your second year?
Me: Yes, I have the Dean’s scholarship well into my second year as well, and my uncle and aunt will continue to support me.
VO: Okay.
(Then she was reading through something on the screen. She was doing this a lot during my interview and overall for others too maybe, cause other people were standing idly by her counter as well for a while.)
VO: I see you have previous rejections, was that trip for the USMLE? (many interviewees that day were going for their USMLE Step 3 or clinical rotations, just btw)
Me: Um, not exactly. I was also going for my clinical electives at ______ (this is a top ranked university in the US) where I had the chance to work with Dr ____ and another clinical elective at ______ (a famous research hospital in the US) to work with Dr ____. (I was excitedly telling her about the Drs because I genuinely find them both to be amazing)
VO: Are you not giving USMLE now?
Me: No. As I said, I am not pursuing a clinical career anymore. Im pursuing research.
VO: (I don’t recall the exact question. She asked me to elaborate on my career change. Like why I wasn’t practicing as a medical doctor and why I’m currently pursuing this degree and research?)
(I told her about when I switched and what led me to change my career to research. I just answered honestly.)
VO: How have your circumstances changed since then?
(I got confused because I thought I already elaborated on my career change so I mentioned it again and how this is for a masters degree.)
VO: No, what has changed? Did your sponsors not fund your trip last time?
Me: Oh no, my aunt and uncle weren’t my sponsors then. It was my father. He was sponsoring my trip last time.
VO: What do your parents do?
VO: How come your aunt and uncle are sponsoring you this time? How did that happen? (again, I don’t remember her exact words but she wanted me to elaborate why I made this change and how my aunt and uncle came to be my sponsors this time)
(I explained how they became my sponsors. They have been supportive of me throughout my application cycle and offered to fund my education. And I accepted.)
VO: Okay.
(Then she kept reading something. Kept scanning my passport. Was mostly looking at her screen during my interview. This felt like forever.)
VO: Alright, everything looks okay.
(Now this I was unprepared for, what should I say now lol. Should I say thanks or okay? So I just kept quiet lol)
VO: Im approving your visa! (Then she went on to explain how I will get my passport in 3-5 days, that she will keep my passport but return my I20 and SEVIS page. How I should keep this safe and make sure to bring it with me while travelling for the US Port of Entry I guess. I was in sheer shock so I was just blankly staring)
Me: Thank you! Thank you, hope you have a wonderful day ahead!
Took my documents and my folder and just rushed out.
The interview was longggg, as you can read. My VO was taking long interviews of nearly everyone I could see in that counter but it was not necessarily a bad thing. A lot of them were approved; you just had to be concise in your answers. The length itself can be intimidating, but if you’re honest and you’ve done your homework it will go well inshaAllah.
My brothers were a great source of help for me. They conducted my mock interviews and helped me throughout. One of my brothers is on an F1 visa in the US and I mentioned it in the DS160 form as well. But as you can read, she asked me nothing about that. I even mentioned an uncle in the US in my previous DS160 form for my B1/B2 applications, but she asked nothing about that either.
I reached out to many Pakistani students in the US through friends and friends of friends who all told me about their visa experiences and how it’s so straightforward and nothing to worry about. They were all super supportive and encouraging as well.
I used this group and the F1 visa experiences group on facebook a lot to gauge the kind of questions I could be asked and to learn from other people’s experiences. I made it a point to read mostly the approved posts. The rejected posts, though a lot more in number, serve to discourage and demotivate you. But yes, you can also learn from them. I still suggest reading mostly the approved posts. I even reached out to 
Rana Ibrar
 who was so gracious with his time and advice and guided me. He conducted a mock interview, told me about all possible questions, and was overall very motivating. He basically said: Your visa is approved! Long before I heard it in the consulate lol. JazakAllah Abrar!
Good luck to everyone applying. The 3Cs mentioned in this group’s featured post is spot on, and you will find anyone on the internet saying the same. Your finances, credibility as a student, and your commitment to the course and country and laws is what’s important. Which they will gauge from your interview mostly. If you are a genuine student and your finances are in order you should have no problem getting that visa inshaAllah.

Visa status: Approved on 1st attempt alhamdulillah(Arrived in USA on 28th December 2022)
Interviewer was a short haired blondie on counter 3
***PS. The interview was long as I tried to drag it as much as possible, so I will try to write as much as I can remember bear with the long post I hope it can be helpful***
Me: Hello
VO: Hey, how are you?
Me: I am good, I hope you are doing well too.
VO: thank you, May I have your picture
Me: Sure, here you go?
VO: How much time has passed since you got this captured?
Me: Maybe 2 months or a little over I don’t remember exactly.
VO: Is your picture edited?
Me: Oh yes, I guess it is as I got it taken at a studio
VO: Alright, may I have your documents please?
Me: You mean the bundle they made at first security check?
VO: Yeah that’s the one
Me: Here you go!
VO: Thank you (takes a glance at my documents and started typing away on her computer vigorously)
Me: Pleasure is all mine!
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going for higher studies, masters in civil engineering precisely.
VO: (continues typing while asking) Which university did you applied to?
Me: Oh I applied to 4 universities and got accepted at Lamar university
VO: Where else did you applied to?
Me: I applied at 3 other universities *told the names*, I originally planned to go for bridgeford but the communication with them was not so efficient and Lamar had swift responses so I thought why not!
VO: Can you tell me about your bachelors course?
Me: You mean the whole curriculum or the background of what it was about?
VO: Yeah the background (still focusing on her computer)
***BTW a handful tip try to get the interviewers’ attention because that is actually an indication that she is interested in knowing about you and most likely to grant you a visa so stop making robotic internet responses come up with your own originality***
Me: I explained about my bachelors and research major
VO: Ok so who is funding your studies?
Me: Well ofcorse my father is funding my studies as I am a student and I don’t work plus I also was able to get scholarship on merit basis
VO: What does your father do?
Me: He is a businessman
VO: What kind of business he runs?
Me: Oh he rents out heavy machineries for road carpet finish and supplies bitumen.
VO: Sorry, what bitumen?
Me: Uh you know the finish product of the road, small black rocks used for carpeting the roads.
VO: Oh yeah I got that, so why did you chose civil engineering for masters?
(She was continuously typing at this point too and I was trying to drag the convo as much as I can so she can start talking to me actually face to face)
Me: Ok so the story goes way long back, my father supported and encouraged me a lot regarding my education and such as I have no brother he placed all his expectations on me in this regard and trained me for such so that when I grow up I can help him with the business handling and that’s the reason it became my passion to actually learn about what my father does and to help him improve I wanted to learn about it from a worldly aspect so that we can adapt the technology and methods used around the world.
VO: Oh wow that’s cool!
(She glanced at me and started typing away again and I stood there waiting but seconds felt like hours and it felt like the pause was too long so I started talking again)
Me: While doing my thesis I got lucky and my bachelors research preprint got published too which was a milestone for me.
VO: (finally she leave her computer leaned on the table and turned her whole attention towards me and that felt like an achievement at that moment TBH) Tell me more about it.
Me: So my research was about the airport management at Karachi Jinnah Intl Airport and its aspects.
VO: How is airport management related to what you want to study?
Me: Yeah the infrastructure and management aspect you know.
VO: Ohhh now that’s cool, Congratulations your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you!
***She was giving me the yellow approval slip alongwith my documents bundle from the small window and suddenly stopped either ends of the documents in each of our hands***
VO: When does your classes start?
Me: Oh they start from 17th Jan 2023.
VO: Alright you are free to go
(I took the document and went straight outside without seeing back and out where I cam from in)
***Remember you can be nervous it doesn’t matters because the officers are well aware of that no matter how hard you try to hide it it’s just going to get worse so do not bother with that but don’t lose your composure in the process this is the thing you need to work on. Never ever express your gratitudes and emotions and joyness when your visa gets approved as it is going to convey that you are desperate and most highly chance of getting rejected because they can do it that is what they are checking from the very beginning till the end, they are not interested in you because of all those robotic answers they hear all day long so make them actually talk to you, and last but not the least recite some duas for ease all the time on the way to the embassy till you stand in front of the interviewer, don’t think about acception or rejection that’s the main thing and you will automatically start to talk without any hesitation***
That’s all for now if you have any further questions feel free to ring my inbox and best of luck for thise who have upcoming interviews believe in Allah have faith in yourself and ace the interview afterall you are paying a hefty amount just to get to talk with the person and still you have to be nervous from thise who are taking your money, give yourself a prep talk and you are good to go.
Best Regards

Interview experience. F1 visa. Karachi Embassy.
Alhamdulillah got my visa approved.
They only asked for my DS 160 confirmation,SEVIS, I20 and most recent passport at the entrance. Visa officer also checked only these. Didn't ask for anything else.
VO: 
Morning
Me: Morning
Then he asked for the finger-scanning. I did it. Then he asked the first question.
Why MBA?
I was about to answer and he interrupted, ""something went wrong with prints, we will have to repeat.""
This did throw me a bit as it disrupted my thoughts flow. But I scanned my fingers again and then he repeated same question.
VO: Why MBA?
Me: I answered, it was based on personal details.
VO: Why this university?
Me: Multiple reasons. It has really good marketing program, something I am interested in majoring. It also has a cool academies program. Where students get one to one mentorship and get to work on real life business cases. Also it's somewhere I have previously attended a summer exchange program at 6 years ago. And finally, they give a really good financial aid package.
VO: (Looked at my I20). So who is paying for it?
Me: Like I said I have really good financial aid package. And for the rest I have taken out a student loan.
VO: Did you get the loan from Pakistan?
Me: No, prodigy finance.
VO: Based on what information did they approve your loan?
Me: Oh just my employment history, bank history and credit score.
VO: Do you have friends or family in USA?
Me: No, first one from my family to be going there.
VO: That's nice.
Then he typed for like a full minute or 2 which felt like ages and then said, congratulations, your visa has been approved. You will get an email when your passport is ready to be collected.
He also handed me a yellow slip saying my visa is approved and how will I collect it.
PS:. From what I read here, I thought yellow was administrative processing and blue was approval. But approval is yellow.

Q1, 
What are the courses you’re going to study in first semester?

Ans, After graduation last year, I joined the xyz industry and I noticed a commonality amongst CEOs of top 10 companies operating here which was that 7 out 10 CEOs have all studied from the USA. And since I also want to make my career in Pakistani xyz industry, having studied in the US would increase my odds of a successful career in Pakistan Significantly.
Q2, When did you graduate? 
Ans, Last year in 2022, in the months on June/July
Q3, What did you do after that?
Right after graduation I joined xyz organisation’s headquarters for an internship for a period of 3 months and while still there I landed a job at the headquarters of abc and I have been working here since then.

Q7, (Pointing towards to amount on I20) VO asked about how I’ll arrange the funds needed for the second year of my master’s as the amount written on i20 is only for 1st year.
Ans, I already have the funds needed for second year of my masters as can be seen from my bank statements. My family has liquid funds of double the amount needed in I20 allowing for any unforeseen circumstances.
Q8, Please show me your bank statements
Ans, Passed the statements to the VO
Kept looking on the screen and then said that the US visa laws are very strict I’m sorry and then gave me a white slip.

Sharing this experience as a hope for many of you guys who will be appearing in their third attempt. I was refused twice in May and June from Islamabad Consulate. I applied again with the same profile after deferring my admission in the Karachi Consulate. 
I was refused first time around for showing myself self sponsoring my education even though I wasn't doing any job and my father had given me the funds back then too. It was a blunder from 
my side in the first attempt. 
2nd time around, the interview lasted only a minute, before visa officer refused me without asking any major questions. It was quite tough to gather the confidence for applying again after such an interview. 
Interview on 26th October.
University of Houston.
Master's in Industrial Engineering.
Karachi Consulate. 
Visa officer was an American Male in his 40's. 
When I reached the counter, we greeted each other and after that there was a pause of around 2-3 minutes without Vo asking me anything as he was going through my profile. 
Vo: Tell me about your parents.
My mother is a housewife. My father is an industrialist, we have have a business of manufacturing of adhesives and lubricants which my grandfather started 50 years back and after him his sons are managing it now and also the reason why I want to do industrial engineering, as I have to comeback and manage it afterwards.
Vo: In how many uni's did you apply?
I applied to a total of 5 uni's, out of which I got accepted into 4 of them. I applied to Clemson University where I got rejected from, and I got acceptances from UIC, USF, FSU and UOH where I'm going. Among them I choose University of Houston because Houston is a big industrial city and UOH has strongly industrial affiliated faculty. There are couple of professors at UOH, who take their students for industrial visits every week as part of their curriculum which enhance their practical knowledge which I'm looking for. 
I was quite animated at this moment and was making some hand gestures which annoyed the Vo. He asked me to stop doing that and answer him as I was talking to a friend. 
Vo: So you have one brother who is handling your family business? (I don't know where he got this from)
I told him that I have two elders brothers and they are also handling the business and well.
Vo: Have your brothers also studied from aboard?
No. They have got their education in Pakistan. 
Vo: Why do they want to send you abroad?
Told the visa officer how many brothers always wanted me to get the exposure and how they have always encouraged me to pursue education from abroad. I did an Aiesec internship in 2019, mentioned that too.
After this the Vo stopped asking questions and tried to make a decision but he was undecided at this time. I asked him I could help him with anything else but he said that he is not sure either way right now. I asked him should I tell him about why choose Industrial Engineering in the first place. He said no and that I would have read the website and would just pour it all out on him. 
I said no, just let me explain why I wanted to do Industrial Engineering.
Told him about Industrial Engineering and how USA is the pioneer of this field and that only a couple of uni's in germany and canada are offering this course with the same curriculum. Also mentioned that I have acceptances from Canada and Australia as well but I choose USA because of their quality etc.
Vo: Did your Visa also got rejected from Canada and Australia?
No. I didn't apply for Visa there, as I wanted to study Industrial Eng and my courses were different there.
Vo was still undecided trying to make a decision.
Vo: How big is your industry.
Told him about the number of people working there.
Vo: Okay, tell me about your time at Turkey.
Told him about Aiesec and how this internship gave me exposure and boosted my confidence etc. 
Eventually, the Vo handed me the blue slip. 
Vo: Enjoy your time in the USA.

After that i figured out that
My university told me the total expenses for 1 year are $15k but in i20 form they mention total expenses for 7 months are $15k. Can that be a reason? Although i showed the available funds of 21k but it was same for 7 months.

Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world.

Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.

Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.

Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.

After few minutes typing on computer officer gave me pink slip that your visa is approved. 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that it's very hard to get cleared in second attempt but never loose hope and stay calm. 
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

I found this reason very unique and I am impress with the work of proffessor and I want to work with him on my own research idea which is quite similar in the field. The idea is how we can implement machine learning on ATM for differently able people over here in pakistan because no company is providing service for differently able people.

Hay Good Morning
Me: Good Morning
VO: Pass me your passport and I-20
Me: Sure Sir
VO: Put your right hand 4 finger on the scanner
Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

READ THIS COMPLETELY IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO WASTE YOUR $$$ AND BE TRAPPED BY THESE SO-CALLED CONSULTANTS
All this started back in October 2022.
Firstly, I decided to go USA for my further studies as an undergraduate student, I chose my desired university but as I was blank and didn't know about this group I got trapped by one of the consultants in Karachi
OceanMall Those who live in Karachi know about it, There's a similar agency by the name of Ocean. I went there and discussed my university they told me they are associated with them but later on they got back to their word when I paid out their upfront fee and they forced me to their Panel Unversities
After paying out 40k PKR upfront they shared with me a document that says you need to pay a further 600$ to us for your process which indicates that 2/3 University application fee, SOP, Motivation letter, Internal evaluation of your documents US standards, and attestation from notary public
When I asked about my desired university all their excuse was that I was being so specific about it, and when I paid them and asked them to add one more university in place of my desired uni they acknowledged me we would do it
So, when I 1st paid them 300$ half of the 600$ which was equivalent to 67k PKR back on that date they provided me a single admission letter by the end of Dec 2022, and when I inquired about my money where they spent they refused to keep the transparency with me about anything and further added that when we get the admission letter our job is done, we don't apply to more university until we need. 
when I told them I needed the admission letter from the remaining uni as well I was told this would take 1 or 2 months which I answered I had no issues with that I needed it yet after 1 month they asked me to send my English test to uni that's where I got to know all that time they have not done anything and when I inquired about the last one which they answered ""we are not getting replies by that uni"" when I was personally in touch with that uni I was shocked and utterly disappointed to see that lying wasn't a big deal for them
That's where I wasted my 5 months because of them
Secondly, When I was doing everything on my own I got an acceptance letter and I20 from the university but then again I got trapped by another consultant this time got to learn about that agents who work with different recruiters, and all directly don't apply directly but by through the channels
I got the offer letter from Texas A&M Corpus Christi and the agency asked me to pay the Initial enrollment fee which was $ 1,000 I paid that fee in May 2023 and now I'm chasing them to get my refund back
When I paid out the enrollment fee I was just waiting for the I20, but guess what I have been offered an admission letter but my documents were not submitted still to the university that is again I got to know by the University itself after 2.5 months and the intake also missed out
So now altogether my 4 Lac 6k PKR is stucked with these consultants
Right now at the start of October, I tried to trust another person who was vouched by my friend to take my case and started working on but the person has disappeared now for no reason this time I have not paid anything to that person but, my time YES
My main reason for sharing this experience with you all is that do your research and apply on your own these consultants and recruiters will just gonna waste your time and nothing else
They know how to trap the students by showing scholarship ads and all but in the end they will offer you the same thing which you can find on the university website
This group has everything that a student needs!!!!

My university in previous attempts was SIUE (with 8K/year) scholarship. I’ve been accepted in Purdue Northwest (without scholarship) too, should I go with SIUE  or change it to Purdue?
-> 
My uncle were my sponsor in previous attempts. Now my principal sponsor is my father. (Circumstances changed)
Please guide what should I do as I’m a genuine student with a good profile but still they are refusing me. Should I only go with changed sponsor or should I change university too?
Profile:
BS ECE (3.43/4.00)
IELTS: 7
Been employed in Pak since graduation.
Travel history to UK under a sponsored visit.
Social Work Experience with numerous achievements.

All the time she was interrupted by another lady officer which engaged her in talks, and she was going inside again and again and while asking questions she was writing in her screen,  in whole interview she was in a very good mood and was very casual. I've thought that she'll give me the visa.

In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Good afternoon everybody!
I was refused in April 2023 (F1 Visa).
Now I have changed my university and would like to appear for the interview again.
Unfortunately, I am not able to secure the date before 21st August 2023.
I 
booked the appointment in 1st week of September, I then talked to my university's International department in this regard and they were more than happy to provide me late arrival approval letter in case of attending the orientation and classes online on the zoom.
I consented and they provided me the late arrival approval letter of 1 month (20/09/2023).
Now I want to know if I could not secure the early dates, would I be able to satisfy my Consular officer with that letter?
Anyone with the same experience got their visa approved?
Please step forward and help me in this regard, I would be more than grateful to get assisted.
Thanks and Jazak Allah.

Visa refused (weak ties to home country)
Responses:
Why this university 
There are a couple of reasons for choosing this uni, it is offering me modules like international political economy that no other college in my list offered which directly aligns with my future plans. 
Other than that its location was a major attraction for me, as depaul is in center of Chicago, chicago is very diversified hence I can gain alot of cultural exposure which will further bolster my education.
Lastly, it gave me a generous amount of scholarship
Who is sponsoring you?
My father, what does he do(told)
How many employees in his company?
25-30 
What other schools did you apply to?
I applied top liberal arts schools in uk&usa.
Why did you choose this uni over them?
It had a better sub courses, and offered me more scholarship. 
Can anyone tell me where did I go wrong?

 Well, as everyone knows US ranks at no . 1 for having best education system and new research methods.Illinois State University is also providing American certified degrees which will help me to establish my career here more successful as there are not many experts in this field in my country and we need them.. According to Education Quality and Technology, America is far better than any other country because Germany is also offering research based studies and my field is all about research and survey based in which I’m interested but because of language barrier I can not express  myself there but in US it will be easier for me to communicate and learn.I also had a choice for UK but in UK There’s no multicultural environment.

Alert 
My visa was rejected third time yesterday. 
I went for 3rd attempt after 45 days since second attempt. 
Visa 
officer said I can't give you visa because you were rejected two times before but I give you one advice, "" Don't waste your 185$, you will get same answer. Just give yourself some time "". 
Note: I changed universities in all three times. I knew this could be red flag but i thought as long as i have explanation, it won't be an issue. And I was laid off two months before than interview. So I appeared unemployment there but had two years of work experience. 
Question: I have to wait but how long ? Even if i waited, there is strong possibility that i won't get visa because now i have three rejections.  
I'm going to start my another job soon. 
I'm thinking for Fall 2024. 
What else should I do ? 
I'm worried even if i change my profile and waited, still they may reject by seeing three rejections. 
Betray by seeing rejections but don't want to give up. 
Please give me suggestions.

Hi everyone, 
I appeared for f2 visa and unfortunately it's rejected. Interviewer was lady in Islamabad embassy. 
I need some suggestions to improve for the next time.
Here are the questions that she asked. 
1st 
question:  What is your spouse studying?
Ans: He is doing his PhD from .... university majoring in ...... Engineering 
2nd Questions: when did you guys got married?
Ans: we got married on .... 2023 
3rd Question: how did you guys meet? 
Ans: Mam he was my first cousin so we both knew each other from childhood 
She said something about cousins marriage that I didn't understand because she was not audible to me. And she rejected. 
For F2 visa I don't have anything to change in my visa application. Mostly in the posts people say that VO starts interview by asking that what did you change in the application and why it was rejected last time. I don't have proper answers for both of these questions. 
Please give me your suggestions.  Thanks.

To the people getting rejected: I know it may seem like that you are rejected for no reason and many of you have posted sharing your concerns that you are rejected and have expressed your frustration too. So let me explain you the major reason. Before I explain you the reason let me tell you that I have received two F visas and one J visa with no travel history before my first visa. Currently I am doing my PhD. So one of the major reason is Finances.
Let’s be honest when you 
show bank statements, are you really going to be using those finances? And VO knows that! They know that the 70 lacs you are showing many of you don’t intend to use that money and just showing it to get the visa. After you get the visa, you will start thinking how you will pay for your education. So if you don’t have a full-ride or a loan, or a TA or RA ship you won’t be able to pay for your education. Don’t be misled thinking that you will be able to make sufficient money with an on-campus job, the on-campus job is only sufficient enough to pay for some of your expenses such as food, bills and sometimes rent. You can’t pay tuition and health insurance with a part time job and working full-time or working off-campus during semesters is ILLEGAL! Majority of you are rejected primarily because of your finances because your finance story doesn’t make sense. VO knows the cost of living in US, and cost of tuition, they are mentioned on your I-20. So they are well aware that you won’t be able to furnish this amount and the bank statement that you showed is probably just to show so you can get that visa. 
Yes, not getting the visa is disappointing. But it will be more disappointing once you get to US and can’t pay for your expenses. So again if you don’t have a full-ride, A TA/RA offer or majority tuition scholarship, don’t think that you will be able to manage the finances. 
Hope this helps and clears some doubts. Don’t blame the embassy or the system because if you are eligible for visa, you will get one but if you know deep down that “I am just showing these statements to get visa, I won’t be using this money” than know that VO knows this and you won’t get the visa. 
Best of luck!

I was rejected for this upcoming fall semester. 
To improve my application, I need to find a good ranked university.
The MS programs I am looking for are
Data science
Data analytics
Business Analytics
Computer science
Unfortunately my CGPA was 2.95. But I have a over 2 years of relevant work experience. Hence looking for names where i can get accepted with the CGPA and without mandatory GRE.
After my research many universities are saying that they might consider, but they usually don't. Had the same experience last term alot of money was wasted on application fees.
I will be very thankful if someone suggest me good universities with good rank for the spring semester.

Visa Rejection and Approvals (F-1) 
Dear community, 
I have received 3 F visas in the past with no rejections. I have noticed people sharing their profiles and asking why those that have gotten visas think they were rejected. So with that, please take my advice as it suits you. 
1) 
Are you a genuine student? 
You should ask this question to yourself because life in US is not what is shown in Hollywood movies. Life is very challenging there and you being a genuine student means not increasing more issues for yourself. You can’t just change statuses easily, you can’t just start working there, you can’t just marry there, all these who create this illusions in your mind are not truthful. If your intent is to not study than do not consider applying for F visas. 
2) Can you really pay for a university that’s not offering you any scholarship?
With how the economy is of Pakistan, VO knows real well whether you will be able to pay or not. Don’t think you can just work there and pay for Tuition, health insurance, food, rent, bills, and save. You can’t do that on a 20 hour job. Also, it’s hard in a lot of universities now to get jobs and you can’t work off campus, so plan very very carefully. Don’t get yourself in that mess where you are stuck! If you can’t pay for your Tuition don’t lie about it. If you know your parents won’t be able to pay don’t get yourself in a bad shape. It’s better to go a little later with a better financial package than trying to hurry and than being in bad shape.
3) Getting rejected and immediately running for the next appointment 
Mainly those of you that get rejected are getting rejected on showing weak ties. You can’t just suddenly improve your ties in a week. Don’t rush the situation. Give yourself time to see what went wrong, is it really the university or is it that it was pretty obvious during interview that you won’t be able to pay as you say you will be or you were caught in a lie. Don’t underestimate the ability of VO to know about the circumstances. They are really good at scanning people, that’s what they do all day everyday. So lying about a situation will only get you refusals. When you get refused don’t panic and run for the next available appointment. Try to see what you can change depending upon what went wrong in your interview. 
4) Stay away from consultants! 
Applying for US visa and universities is pretty easy. It’s getting a good financial package is what’s difficult. So stay away from consultants!! They mostly are there to drain your money! I got three F visas and never went to a consultant. 
5) keep faith in yourself 
I know it’s easier for me to say that. But, losing faith in yourself will only put you in worst shape than what you are in. Always know, there are tons of places around the world where you can go study. One country is not what will define your future. Always take a step back and try applying to other countries. You might be able to get a really good package somewhere else. So don’t drain yourself emotionally or mentally! 
I hope this helps those who have been rejected and those that will apply in near future

VO was lady rejected F1 student before me.
Fingerprints done after 3 attempts
It was a very long interview.
*Note*There is possibilities that the sequence of questions might be incorrect.
My interview went very smoothly even beyond my expectations. and I was very confident.
VO: Why you specifically want to study in USA?
Me: Officer its quite different from other countries. you guys believe in giving practical exposure along with research opportunity and I really want to explore the multicultural environment of USA. apart from this usa degree will give me competitive advantage here back in Pakistan with tremendous job opportunities. 
So I will definitely experience a good learning environment. 
VO: oh so want to explore the culture as well with smile..
Me: yes Officer university life is not all about studies and I want to explore the cultural diversity of USA.
VO: thats great..
VO: you applied to any other colleges.
Me: yes Officer I applied to DePaul university, Hofstra university, UIC, southern new samphire university and Adelphi university. 
VO: So why you chose DePaul University?
Me: There were a few things that I had in mind for my university selection. The curriculum should have a dedicated career track in business analytics with real time problem solving subjects like capstone and management internship and for these courses recently depaul university has launched beta lab. It’s a virtual platform for students to solve business problem by implementing real world data using different softwares such as SAP, Oracle Tableau and power BI. Also I’m particularly interested business intelligence and big data analysis and Don Pitchell who director of business analytics program is one the top researchers in the area. So If I would get a chance to work under him as a research assistant it would be greater opportunity for me. 
VO: okay… 
Me: yes Ma’m I have also done extensive research prior to applying at DePaul University. 
VO: ohh so you have contacted any students.
Me: yes Officer I have contact with current student and I found out that students can actually interact directly with professor rather than their TA, I mean what else do I need student right.
VO: How this will relate with you future goals? 
Me:I want to pursue career as a business analyst, which is the fastest growing field literally in every sector of Pakistan. as we’re still developing country and there is a huge market gap in Building tech industry. I will definitely get a good return out of the investment. 
But Officer… 
VO: yeah continue..
Me: My ultimate vision  is to get 3 to 4 years of experience and I will start up my own business consultancy firm. as you know business has been suffered alot in the pandemic and due to lack of disastrous management and modern analytical tools.
VO: is there any family member or other relative in USA. 
Me: No Officer there is no one in USA from my family.
VO: I can see you have been rejected before. 
Me: yes Officer I was nervous because it was my first visa interview and I couldn’t answer to questions that were asked to me and visa officer was not satisfied with my answers and this time I have changed the approach to explain my self.
 VO: have you considered any other country like Canada, UK and Pakistan. 
Me: No Ma’m haven’t considered Pakistan because there a few university that are currently offering Business analytics program and I would hardly get research opportunity and practical exposure. So I will definitely experience a good learning environment. 
VO: what about fundings?
Me: My father is sponsoring me he has savings of *** and *** immovable assists for my studies and part from this I have got 5000 dollar scholarship.
VO: So what does your sponsor do. 
Me: He is a business man and own a well established business.(interpreted) 
VO: what business??
Me: it’s actually Fertilizers distribution business (interpreted) 
VO: its the same business that you’re currently working. 
Me: yes Officer as a Business development Manager. Continue… and he is one few authored dealers of Engro incorporation which is the Pakistan’s number 1 fertilizer production company. And he has been doing this business since 11 years and he has over a dozen of employees and his annual income is ***. 
VO: I know you’re a genuine student and You really want to study in USA but unfortunately you’re not qualified for this time.
Me: Ma’m is there any specific reason. 
VO: No there is not any specific reason but But I’m giving you the slip and reason is mentioned in slip.

Interview Advice for those who got rejected in first Attempt.
You may go with the same university but not with the same profile. VO will must ask you what circumstances have you change this time?
Circumstances mean ur academic, professional, financial or personal circumstances…University is not ur circumstance. 
Try to identify the reason of rejection, improve ur profile accordingly and then apply again with a gap of minimum one month for next attempt for same intake
Re-apply 
with no change in ur circumstances would be a waste of time and money.

Refusal from Australia 
Rejection from uk universities in interview

I was quite nervous because the officer rejected 3 visas in front of me but also he approved 1 student visa so in the start i was narvous 
VISA officer looking like Chinese or japani wearing galasses 
Me : good morning 
Vo : good morning pass me your documents 
Me : here 
Vo : why are you going to usa?
Me : persue my bachelor’s in mechanical engineering 
Vo : when did you completed your high school degree?
Me : 2021

Vo  : pass me your transcripts of high school
Me : passed 
Vo :  what you studied in your high school

Officer look at me for 4 to 5 times in whole  interview then he start typing on computer 
Looking like rude  
Tip no 1 : connect with Allah and tahjud is the key of success. My English speaking skills is so bad but i trust on Allah. When I entered in embassy I recited suras . Also your father and mother prayers help you alot. 
Tip No 2 : officers don’t have time so just gave them straight farward answers .long answers i think boar the officer. 
Tip no 3 : officer is also human being so be confident he will not eat you even if your speaking skills are not good he will understand  your answers 
I think officer have an access of bank accounts and nadra because he didn’t ask me about bank statement or any other financial documents 
A lot of help from my brother bilal baloch and Rana Ibrar 
Just follow the steps of brother 
Rana Ibrar
  video of 41 mint on YouTube and also argo videos , green card videos help me alot.

Could someone please explain why my visa was rejected? I have provided the entire conversation below for reference.
VO Identity : Long beard Man 
Location : Islamabad 
Question: Why did you choose MIU or why MIU?
Me: MIU is economical and I can afford it easily right now. I am trained in banking software development, and there are only 32 of us who know the banking software development technology. Their course focuses on Oracle JAVA (Banking software development), which I have 
been working on for 5 years, making it beneficial for my career. My current company has committed to promoting me to a managerial position if I complete an MS in Java, so it is a great opportunity for me. He says ""Wow, great.""
Me: If you want to see it, I have a commitment letter from my company. He says ""No need.""
Me: Additionally, MIU's curriculum involves studying only one subject and taking exams at the end of each month. Also, MIU offered us CPT.
Question: I saw on your F1 Form you need $. Who will pay this fee?
Me: Sir, I am on self-finance. It's my savings, and if I need more for the next year, my father is a landlord, and he will easily pay this fee.
Question: How many universities have you applied to?
Me: Four (Drake Uni, MIU, and Mississippi Uni).
He: And which university has selected you?
Me: Drake and MIU.
He: Then why didn't you choose Drake?
Me: Actually, MIU responded first, so I continued my process with MIU.
Question: In your DS_160, I see you already did MSCS. Then why do you want to start MS again?
Me: Sir, actually, I already told you that I have been working on Java for 5 years, and my MS was in Data Science. There is no future for data science in Pakistan, so I want to start MS again, but in Java.
then he start typing completely silence  for 2 mints then i startd talking
additionally sir,  I follow Dr. abc on Google Scholar. I have published six papers internationally, so his research papers are relevant to my research, and if my visa application is approved, I'll work with him in the future.
Question: In which field did you publish your research papers?
Me: Data Sciences.
And then he gave  me a yellow rejection paper.

Interview 19th May 2023 
Rejected 
University of arizona 
Bacholars
Please everyone read it and let me know what can I improve in next interview and what were my mistakes because my classes will Start soon and I can't delay them, I already had a gap year.
Vo:show me your documents
Me: passed them
Vo: financial statement 
Me: passed them
Vo: this is just a bunch of papers
( I didn't knew what to answer about it, like I can not bring money here obviously it have to be on paper) whatever
Me: explained that this is my mother's account and it has money generated from her school/collage.
Vo: which school
Me: named the school
(It's a local school)
Vo: started typing the name of school on computer, maybe he was searching about the school.
Vo: which university 
Me: university of Arizona 
Vo: how did you got to know about it?
Me: searched about good ranking universities and so
Vo: what will you study 
Me: software engineering 
Now here I am a little confused, I can not remember what he asked for, maybe my future plan or maybe why I want to study software engineering.
Me: I proceeded to explain him that I what to convert my mother's school and collage in IT University, as all great university are in lahore  islamabad and karachi, for computer and faislabad is deprived of great universities, so students have to migrate from there to other cities which everyone can not afford. And many parents don't allow and students also have safety problem.
Vo: that's more than enough
(The reality is that, EVERYTHING I SAID HERE WAS A LIE, I DONT WANT TO PROCEED WITH THE UNIVERSITY, I WANT TO OPEN A SOFTWARE HOUSE IN PAKISTAN, but I thought that he might not be convinced with software house as it can be opened anywhere and not necessarily in pakistan, so lied about the university. I think this was kind of biggest mistake, as the person before me gave the same kind of Statement 
Like good country man, help my nation, help my brother, help My country, blah blah, something like this, so my statement also seems kind of fake created, that I want to help people of my city.)
Proceeding
Vo: any relatives there
Me: no
Vo: have you been there before
Me: no
Vo: siblings 
Me: one is AS and second one in 7th class
Vo: father
Me: banker in ...... bank 
Me added we have rental home from where get rent.
(This was not true but i had to justify the bank statement soo) 
Vo: how many
Me: 4
That's what I remember, 
Then he took some time, disappear to side or somewhere, then proceeded to give the yellow paper, 
The paper said that I could not establish ties with my country, and I am not proving that I will return.
Now things I am planning to change. 
1. Tell them the real aim, of building software house
2. Take my ntn, proof which shows that there is a school which is on my mother's name.
What else should I improve, please share your valuable views.

Guide: How to get an Emergency visa appointment for F1 visa category.
I had been very anxious over the past week as my interview appointment date was 4 days after my classes start date (on i20). 
I mailed my university asking for late arrival letter, but they rejected my request and instead sent me a letter (addressed to the embassy), asking the embessy to provide me with expedited visa interview and why it was of importance that I get an early appointment.
At first I was disappointed because there was no category for F1 visa seekers to apply for emergency, but I selected ""business"" from the dropdown menu and provided a brief explanation as to why it was important for me to get an early appointment. I uploaded my i20, letter recevied from university, and the current interview confirmation pdf.
I sent this request on friday night (29th July) and got response back on monday morning (31st July), with slots being available for this very current week!!
I have now rescheduled my interview in this week and hope my experience helps some of you guys/gals in the same boat as I was last week.
In the end all I have to say is that have faith in Allah, and pray. There is not much that you can control in this situation so just try your best and stay positive in any case.
PS: In case you found this post helpful, please remember me in your prayers as I will be appearing for interview in a couple days. Also I request you to kindly not ask me to dm unless absolutely necessary and ask questions in the comments as it will benefit others down the road too. I saw so many dead posts regarding this topic so I finally decided to make one (I almost didn't even apply for emergency appointment because I thought there was no point in doing it).
PS2: Everything above is just based on my own personal experience and I am in no way an expert in this matter.

I have been rejected for B1/B2 visa before
But never for an F1
Should I select the visa refused category when searching for dates, or the other one?
It only asks if I have been refused visa before, it doesn't specify if it is prior F1 visa refusal

Hello guys, I had my visa interview yesterday and it got rejected. During the interview the VO asked me about my bank statement, i showed it to her and then she goes where did all these funds come from? I replied that my father transfered all the funds from our family saving account to this account to carry out my university expenses? She said do you have the statement for the family savings account, I didn’t had it with me that time and after two three questions she rejected 
my visa. also note my father opened this account in December 2022 , do you think this could be the reason for rejection?

Vo: you are already studying in a university in pakistan so why u r going to usa
Me: bcz my father suggested me to go to usa bcz he wants to expand his business to other cities like abc city and also if add more reasons, usa education system focuses on critical thinking, discussions and practical skills while pakistani education system just has traditional exam oriented approach 
Vo: ok ok alright (stopped me speaking)

I wasn’t so confident during interview but I wasn’t also below average, confidence was average. My fluency was like 7/10. But I didn’t looked scared besides I was, i made it look cool with a very little smile after i ended answering.
He didn’t asked about my usa university didn’t even name of the uni
Didn’t asked who is sponsoring me, just asked father’s business 
He was just straight to point I don’t know why he was so suspicious even i had every document real.
He was a very very long beard guy in his 30’s 
This post is not to “discourage” i know something was wrong with my case or my visa interview.

Hello guys today i had my interview
Visa : approved
Literally no question was asked I just went there greeted her. No document was checked and asked for. The VO was a lady who herself was from penn state and joked with me that penn state has the best ice cream and then she approved my visa.
Edit: people are saying that how lucky Iam, but that is not the case. I already had a very strong case and had no reason to be rejected. I was already a B1/B2 visit visa holder. I had visited USA 4 times and always returned showing I had strong ties to my country and most of all I had an outstanding university (you can check). The VO also being from penn state acted as a cherry on top.

Assalam-o-Alaikum all I'm in need of your assistance. My visa application has been rejected twice at the Islamabad Embassy, despite receiving a generous scholarship offer from the university. My challenge lies in the fact that I have already completed my Master's degree. Whenever I attend the interview, the first question I am asked is why I wish to pursue a second Master's degree, and this is where my visa application gets denied. Therefore, I kindly request your guidance on 
how to secure admission for a Ph.D. program. My academic background includes an MSCS (Data Science) degree with 3.37/4.00 cgpa with research , and I am looking for an economically viable option with available scholarships and a streamlined application process. Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

My F1 was rejected in October on 214b and i have reapplied for December.
I have changed my sponsor. Initially I was the only sponsor and now i have shown my father as the main sponsor, i also got 5000 USD scholarship from university and around 9000 USD i am showing as a community loan which i will be taking after visa approval.
How do I answer the question about why i have changed so much in my finances in just 2 month time as initially i said i have the required funds to cover 
my complete education and now I have showing a loan and my father as sponser.
Need advise how to answer this!

Me: I have various reasons but mainly because of my dean, Mr. scott beaulier he is PHD from George Mason university and have more than 10 years of professional experience and i believe i can learn alot under his supervision moreover the overall faculty was very helpful and cooperative.
Vo: Do you have someone in the states?
Me: Yes my brother is there !
Then he asked me questions about him and his face expression totally changed after he came to know my brother is there !!
I know that is why my visa is refused.
But overall it was really a bad day at embassy , I have seen only two girls getting blue slips otherwise it felt like a yellow day at embassy!
I was pretty much confident and was not nervous.
If anyone else got a visa today please share the experience and Congratulations to those two girls

Looking for the genuine help! 
I've been rejected twice in the F1 Visa interview at Karachi Consulate (1st by Chinese VO, 2nd by 1st counter American with slightly bald personality).
I have 100% scholarship from the university for my masters. I've applied to only one school though. 
Should I apply for the third time with the same profile or leave it?
I'm just concerned that I don't want to change my university, but what should I say when the VO will ask ""What Circumstances Have You Changed This Time?"".

VO: 
(after passing documents and after scanning fingers) why are you going to US
Me: I'm going to study masters in computer science from Maharishi international university
VO: Why this university
Me: I have chosen this university because it's offering the courses that I was looking for. I'm working as a consultant and I have to get expertise in (mentioned 4 subjects). These fields are very important for my consultancy position and MIU is offering courses related to all these subjects.
VO: Do you have any travel history
Me: No sir
VO: Who's sponsoring you
Me: My sister
VO: I can't give you visa, reason is mentioned on this slip.
Question1: What could be the possible reason for rejection? 
Question2: I applied for November intake. Should I try again or wait for February intake?
Question 3: should I add my current employer as my sponsor (they are willing to sponsor me). Would that be a plus? I'm afraid it will make my case suspicious that why your company wasn't sponsoring you before.

Visa refused (weak ties to home country)
Responses:
Why this university 
There are a couple of reasons for choosing this uni, it is offering me modules like international political economy that no other college in my list offered which directly aligns with my future plans. 
Other than that its location was a major attraction for me, as depaul is in center of Chicago, chicago is very diversified hence I can gain alot of cultural exposure which will further bolster my education.
Lastly, it gave me a generous amount of scholarship
Who is sponsoring you?
My father, what does he do(told)
How many employees in his company?
25-30 
What other schools did you apply to?
I applied top liberal arts schools in uk&usa.
Why did you choose this uni over them?
It had a better sub courses, and offered me more scholarship. 
Can anyone tell me where did I go wrong?

Me. Good morning
Vo. No reply. Give me your i20 and passport
Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world. Degree obtained from usa has much more worth then any of other countries here in pakistan. They also offer practicle courses, flexible education and cultural diversity further enhanced the educational experience. 
Vo. what are you going to study
Me. I going to peruse masters of cyber security.
vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.
Vo. Sory, we can not approve your visa this time and gave me slip.
Experts please tell me where did I go wrong.

Me: I don't know. Maybe i loose my confidence or due to bad circumstances.
VO: But you had to clearify from the last Visa officer that why she's refusing your Visa?
.......I was really confused at this question and didn't know what to answer.......
Than I simply replied that you (V officers) don't tell the actual reason to the candidates.
She started typing on computer and i still had a Hope that I've given my best full confidently so after typing she just gonna approve my Visa but when she put yellow slip in front of me than I was really shocked.

Visa category: F1 Previously refused
I am unable to get an appointment for F1 visa interview at Karachi consulate as there are no dates available. Please guide regarding the following:

2) 
What are the chances of getting a slot in Karachi? My classes start on 24th August.
3) CGI portal issue: its giving me error message that you are approaching maximum number of times you may view this page but not showing me city/date options to select from. I have submitted my case on “provide feedback” anyone else experiencing the same?

Embassy: Karachi
Refused on first interview (9th December) 
Master of science in computer Science from University of the pacific. 
In my first attempt, they asked me only four questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I applied again a 4 days after my first attempt. 
ME: Good morning Officer,
VO: Good Morning, 
VO: Why you are going to the USA? 
ME: Officer I am going to pursue my master's in Computer Science.
VO: okay so why going to study there?
Me: USA has the highest Academic standard, also they have more hands on practice learning. Apart from this graduating from a USA university can lead me to the senior level job in pakistan.  
VO: Ahaan, So where are you currently working?
Me: I am working as a ******* Engineer at (Company name) 
VO: Sorry as a? 
ME: Told my position, and company name again. 
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Told detailed of skills i worked.
VO: How did you applied for this university?
ME: Officer, I applied for total four universities, and I applied through websites. 
VO: Which universities you applied to?
ME: Told all four universities name.
VO: Where is ******** university?
ME: told the city name, after saying it I smiled and said officer at this time even I don’t remember the exact location but it's situated in this city. 
VO: Smiles and said Even i have also heard the university name first time 
So, where is university of the pacific i haven’t heard that as well. 
ME: Officer, it's in Stockton, California even though they have their three campuses and told the other cities name. And i am going to Stockton campus.
VO: Ohh, okay. 
VO: Your fees is quite expensive, who is going to pay it. 
ME: My father is sponsoring me, as he is a Consultant Doctor.
VO: Also, then it's expensive.
ME: Officer, we have assest which worth around ****** in the form of properties.

ME: I said No mam, we are not affected so much then other these areas (stated other cities name)
VO: Okay. 
Then asked me about my brothers and what they do. Also Asked anyone relative in the USA.
After few minutes typing on computer officer gave me pink slip that your visa is approved. 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that it's very hard to get cleared in second attempt but never loose hope and stay calm. 
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!
"

Hi guys, My visa was refused on 31 Jan the worst day of my life. I was not expecting that I was sure that I am a genuine student and that my profile is so strong my visa will not be refused but it is. I went into depression and couldn't even talk to my parents for a few days then I decided I am not gonna try again. I should switch to Australia and apply there. And I was scared that maybe my Australian visa will be refused because my USA visa is refused. I contacted many 
consultants they said It's not a big deal. I asked a few questions in this group and came to know that it's not a big deal many students got visas on the second attempt. So I gathered information from everyone and came to the point I should try again for the USA. because if my Australian visa is refused there will be no chance that my USA visa will be approved. So I defer my semester to fall 2023. So I want to know from you guys What I should change to my application?
Should I change university? All other students who applied to that uni got visa approval, not even a single one got a refusal.
Should I add another sponsor along with my father?
Those guys who got approval after rejection please tell me what you guys did.
Lastly, I want to tell you to say your interview did not go well which may be the reason. But my interview lasted for 15 minutes and I answered everything. But when I posted my experience in this group I realized that I made 1 to 2 mistakes but that's not a reason for refusal.

Hello everyone
One of my friend and me appeared in islamabad consulate on 14 April with regular appointment instead of previously refused.No one questioned us on this and we saw no.of students with regular but i have seen a post in this group a student got refused by karachi consulate because of using regular appointment.
I don’t think officer have any problem with your appointment category and give refusal on the basis of appointment category because they don’t know about this 
and they never asked for appointment confirmation slip on interview counter.
Anyone here who used regular appointment in karachi consulate without any problem instead of previously refused?

Hay Good Morning

VO: Pass me your passport and I-20
Me: Sure Sir
VO: Put your right hand 4 finger on the scanner
Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.

He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Me: Yes, 
VO: okay, what did you change in your profile/application? 
Me: I changed my way of confidence and i am prepared this time for Interview. In my last 2 visa interviews I was not much confident and did not deliver the satisfactory answers and spoiled the whole interview session. 
VO: what universities did you applied and why you applied only in those universities and why you chose this university. Me: told the universities names where I applied, and told her When I was searching on internet the best university in the US for MS Marketing with concentration of Data mining USF was on the top of the list then I researched more about the university and found out it is alligned with what I was looking for!! 
VO: why this course? Me: allow me few minutes elaborate my whole situation, as you can see in my DS160 my previous education is engineering, when I joined the company where I am currently employed I got a chance to work with their marketing and I found my hidden skills of marketing. After working and more with the marketing team my interest in this field increased but I observed myself there are still some gaps which needs to be filled and this course will help me to fill those gaps. During the session the VO was countinuously reading what was written on her computer screen instead of typing, I think she was reading notes dropped by previous visa officers on my application. 
VO: sorry, you can not qualify for US visa because you did not change anything in your profile/application.

I am sharing my profile and f-1 visa interview experience which is refused. Kindly tell me what mistakes I made and what should i do.
Profile.
MS in mathematics from NUST I was admitted to Ph.D. mathematics at a fully funded scholarship at RPI.
Interview experience.
VO: Good morning pass me your i-20 and passport.
Me. 
Good morning. yes sure
VO. Why do you want to get higher studies?
Me. Well, my father is a teacher and he teaches me basic mathematics in my school. He developed my interest in mathematics and support me in my higher studies. I got a silver medal in MSc and also did my MS from a top-ranked university in Pakistan. And now I want to be a professor after getting Ph.D.
VO. What are you doing since your last degree? (I didn't understand what he said and didn't ask VO to repeat the question).
Me. (I didn't remember what I answered.)
VO. What are you doing now?
Me. I have been teaching in a higher secondary school since April 2019.
VO. Have you visited the US before?
Me. No, I haven't.
VO. Why you are not doing PhD in Pakistan?
Me. I completed my master's from NUST Islamabad which is a top-ranked university in Pakistan. So I don't have a better option after getting MS from NUST. I have received offers from different countries but all of those offers were without funding. During this time I got an opportunity to study in the US with funding, and I accepted this offer.
VO. I can not issue a visa this time. Thank you.
During the interview, VO looks at my i-20 almost 4 times.
(I prepared my interview well. But didn't answer a single question I prepared. I don't know what happened at that time.)

Hello guys! Need help to decide this. My previous 2 visas were refused for Purdue University MSBA at Islamabad Embassy. From interviews, I gathered that my financials were the apparent reason for refusal since I have a student loan. 
I am working on showing complete balance in the bank statement for third attempt. I have an I-20 from Southern Methodist University MSBA with a good amount of scholarship. 
1. 
Should I change my university in the next attempt and would it be a problem since SMU is a downgrade from Purdue? 
2. Would it help at all if I choose Karachi for the next interview? 
3. Can people get in touch or comment who got their F1 visa in 3rd or 4th attempt? Any tips?

Me: Because I wanted to explore the market of embedded system so that later in pakistan i can have a great business out of it. When i did research , i  figured out that US is on the top of list and has a great embedded system market  then i thought what can be better than this studying within USA. So I chose USA for my study.

VO: How many universities did you apply to?
Me: I applied to four universities 
VO: And which universities?
Me: I applied to North Eastern, Dayton, Texas Tech and IIT.
VO: So you got only  one admit?
Me: No, i also got admission from Dayton but for computer science not for Electrical engineering program that i wanted to do, yet  they have not told me their decision for my application of electrical engineering.
VO: Then why not Dayton? (in loud voice with reactive face )
Me: Because I wanted to do masters in electrical engineering with specialization in embedded system and yet they have not told me their decision for my application of electrical engineering so that's why I chose IIT.
Sorry you are not eligible for visa

Is there anyone who got a rejection after Administrative Processing (221g)? Will they notify by email that your visa is rejected?
I have given interview in Karachi Consulate on April 28, 2022 and since then status was ""Refused"" and the date stated of last update was April 28, 2022 but today I checked again and it still says ""Refused"" but date of last updated changed to July 14, 2022. I got no email.
So I am confused that my visa is still under administrative processing or is it refused.

I’ve been refused twice for F-1 visa. I don’t know what VO is looking for. Please guide the following:
-> Should I change my university this time?
My university in previous attempts was SIUE (with 8K/year) scholarship. I’ve been accepted in Purdue Northwest (without scholarship) too, should I go with SIUE  or change it to Purdue?
-> 
My uncle were my sponsor in previous attempts. Now my principal sponsor is my father. (Circumstances changed)
Please guide what should I do as I’m a genuine student with a good profile but still they are refusing me. Should I only go with changed sponsor or should I change university too?

1st Attempt: Approved Alhumdulillah.
Interview was at 25th May Karachi Consulate.
Profile: BS from LUMS, going for MS Finance at University of Houston. Had Received out-of-station tuition waiver and additional scholarship as well. Have been working at Multinational bank for almost two years now.
VO: 
Pass me your passport and F1.
VO:  Why university of Houston?
ME: Firstly, the courses which they are offering, related to derivates trading and hedging and this is where my professional experience lies, as I have been working in the banking industry for over 2 years now, and I feel this degree would help me fill in the gaps in my skill set.
Also, one of my university professors had recommended this course and degree, as he had also completed his master’s from there.
Also, I have been following Professor XYZ, throughout my undergraduate phase, and read his publications on hedging techniques, so I thought it would be quite an experience to take live lectures from him.
VO: interesting!
VO: What is your job ?
ME: Told him about the general job description, routine tasks etc.
VO: Plans after graduation.
ME: Obviously, the plan is to complete my master’s with good GPA. And then to focus on my banking career, as employers in the Pakistani banking sectors tend to value those profiles and individuals who have done their education specifically from US Colleges. In fact, my current supervisor had done his Master’s from abroad, and at a very young age he is doing quite well. I have a similar objective, I believe this degree would help me to excel in the Pakistan banking sector, also that I have made good repo with my supervisor, he would be willing to hire me at a senior position, once I complete my master’s.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME:  it is my father.
VO: What is his profession?
ME: He is a banker as well, and currently working in one of the banks in UAE.
VO: Pass me the statement.
I handed over the statement to him.
VO: Your credentials are good, I am approving your visa. You will get your passport in a week.
For all the aspirants out here, the only thing matters is your level of confidence and communication skills. Regardless of the circumstances, and whatever is the outcome, just give your 100% and maintain eye-contact.

(The hall went completely empty, I was the only one except guards. Shortly, VO came to the counter)
VO: Ok so, you can take these documents back and we've approved your visa. (Passed me the blue slip while smiling)
Me: thank you. (Smiled back)
VO: Enjoy your stay with your family. (Said happily)
( For most of the time, she kept looking and typing at the screen. Didn't look at me for longer than a second or two during each of my answers. Also my answers were brief and to the point so she didn't have to look for long either.
I kept an eye contact during the whole interview and also maintained a bit smile throughout my interview though it went quite long and I had to wait a lot in between too.
I had a plus point of already having a visit visa so I used that in start while answering the question of why I chose that uni. As I heard that the VO may have not gone through all your data so you should convey them such info yourself.
Though my answers were not in detail but i did prepare myself for any type of detail. I made a list of all possible questions and prepared the detailed answers then filtered out the important information only.  Saved the detail for only the case if they themselves ask me to go into.
You should definitely have all the information about the university you're applying to. They should not get the idea that you've selected a university without doing any proper research)

Greetings Everyone. 
Any 
kind of help would be truly appreciated.
Profile:- 
1) 2.59 GPA Reason for low is that I never knew min 3 will be required and no one was there to guide . 
2) Took IELTS academic back in 2020 scored 7.0 overall
3) More than 5 + years of experience in relevant field in top tier organisations locally and international. After this extensive period in the industry, I want to pursue masters as It would open doors for me in my professional growth. 
4) Undergrad Major = Computer science 
5) certification = data analytics , digital marketing , sql and other related 
Can somebody please guide me of the universities that I eligible for, I have a list of universities that are accepting 2.5 -2.7GPA but when i went to some of the university websites, they are preferring more than the mentioned. 
I also have an offer letter of Western New England and Mercy college NY but the course fee of thee ranges 3500-3800$. So it will be really hard for me to earn this much of amount. 
Also my budget is in the range of 25-30 lac for the first semester. And after that need to earn it on my own.
Can someone help me in find the university where I can pay my fee and can help me get a visa in the discipline of data analytics, business analytics, big data, data science or realted ones ?
Also are there any members who had a similar case like mine and that they were able to succeed in this journey. 
Thank you so much in advance for the help. JazakAllah o khair

These questions are so simple but in a way its more difficult for those students who are feeling hesitation in front of visa officer.
So the thing all students have to do is Just be confident and look in the eyes of the visa officer. Don’t lie about anything, they already have your background data and talk to them what they ask in simple words. 
Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

Even if the don't approve my sabbatical leaves I'll resign and rejoin after completing my MBA. I know I  will get the job with my acquaintance and credibility 
Vo: congratulations you VISA is approved. 
*Posting this for encouraging all those people who are scared of several things. My case my pretty critical, chances of rejection was high because of primarily two reasons:
1. My brother lives in USA currently he recently got graduated from Louisiana state university and is in opt right now( vo didn't even asked about him)
2. Secondly my sponsor was my mother's cousin who is a US citizen.
But that's not a big thing if your are confident and sound genuine, means your story should sound real not made up. The most important thing is your  faith in Allah. If you say that I have strong faith but stillyou feel scared and week then your beliefs are not strong. I would like to thanks

INTERVIEWER: INFAMOUS ASIAN
NO GRE
NO IELTS
GPA 2.86
Date: 8th June.
DISCLAIMER: My interview was very different from others so please don't take it as a guide as I don't want to mislead anyone.
After preparing myself for straight 20 days I went for an Interview, I was prepared for every kind of question, but there was something else written in my fate.
VO DID NOT ASK ANY COMMON QUESTIONS LIKE:
Why US? 
Why this university?
Rather he started like this
1) what are your daily responsibilities in your current job?
2) what does your father do? (Convinced with my one word ANSWER)
3) what are your plans after graduation? (Told him the names of 3 it companies name where I'm aiming to work at)
4) do you have any relatives? I said yes because I didn't want to lie
5) will you leave the current job? I said yes (btw I just joined that job 20 days ago)
Conclusion: All that time he was behaving as if the decision is already decided because he seemed too uninterested to hear my answers. It was like as if he was just completing a formality nothing else.
In a nutshell, for me US F1 VISA IS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON LUCK BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A HEC FUNDED PHD LEVEL GUY GETTING REJECTED WHOSE PROFILE WAS 4X STRONGER THAN MINE.
BUT GO WELL PREPARED AND BE CONFIDENT. I ALSO GREETED HIM IN A VERY LOUD VOICE. Also don't forget to pray and take your mother's prayers as they can do wonders.
GOODLUCK!
Thankyou

Visa Status: Approved
I was a bit nervous and none of my answers went 100% smooth.
Here's how interview went.
VO: Hello(in very friendly tone)
Me: Hi
VO: (After taking my docs and entering them on PC) Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going to attend Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Cincinnati.
VO: (After a pause) Why did you choose this University?
Me: (I stuttered during this answer a bit) I am going because this university is aligned with my research interest.
VO: Why did you choose University of Cincinnati specifically?
Me: Because the lab facilities and faculty is suited to my research in additive manufacturing. It's the same research that I did in my bachelor's. (stuttered here too)
VO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father. (I stopped after saying this for around 20 secs and then started speaking again) He is manager at X and makes Y money through job Z money through rentals and some money thru real estate trading which I don't know how much is.
VO: Cograts. Enjoy your stay at united states.
Me: Thanks.
Thoughts? 
The visa doesn't mostly depend on the interview. The VO wasn't even listening to me with attention. It depends on your uni, course and any funding you have(I had $20k scholarship). My interview wasn't the best. Actually, I would say it was average or below average.
Almost all visas(5/5) got approved before me. Only 2 were refused, who went after me. Those 2 had genuine reasons to refuse. If I were VO, I would even refuse them(not cuz of hate lol but their case didn't seem strong on paper)
Suggestions?
1. Don't go for consultants. They apply for you at few unis which VOs are aware of. VOs don't even consider you in that case. They straight away reject you.
2. Take IELTS. Take GRE. Secure full/partial scholarship(you can easily get it). Then go for visa. You will get it InshAllah.

ADMIN URGENT APPROVAL, SINCE I ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL HELPFUL INFO. 
By the grace of Almighty Allah Visa Status: Approved
Type: F1
Time and date: 8:45 am, 22nd May 2023
Embassy: Karachi
VO: An American lady
VO: Good Morning
Me: Good Morning. How are you, ma'am?
VO: Fine, thank you! 
VO: So, why are you going to Georgia State University.
Me: To pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science
VO: Who will sponsor your studies?
Me: Told
VO: What does he do?
Me: Told
VO: Show me your sponsor's statement of account:
Me: Handed it over.
VO: Have you previously applied for a US visa? (looking at my previous record)
Me: No (My parents applied for a US visit a few years ago when I was not old enough to know what was going on, so I couldn't recall it the first time she asked about it).
VO: Are you sure? (Looks at me sideways)
Me: (Then it finally occurred to me that, yeah, my parents had applied for a visa back in the day. I clarified that I was young, so that's why I couldn't recall it. VO laughs it off)
VO: Okay, then, I am approving your visa, and make sure to collect your passport in 2 to 3 days.
Me: Was overwhelmed with emotions and in utter disbelief.
My take: The interview itself lasted hardly 45 seconds. I would say that my sponsor (I'd mind disclosing my sponsor) was the sole reason for my approval. The VO did not ask any other major or college-related questions apart from what was asked above. Also, given my interview experience and what was happening inside the interview room, VOs do not reject you out of rudeness or some other baseless reason. Neither you have met the interviewers nor the interviews have met you. It all comes down to how you present yourself and how genuine of a student you are. Anyway, enough of my Ted talk. 
Thank you, Almighty Allah, my parents, and the countless members of Pakistani Student in USA, who were willing to share their interview experiences regardless of their outcome.
Thank you once again!
Edit:
An important thing I did not mention: I qualified for an out-of-state waiver at the college. Essentially, I've been waived off out-of-state tuition and will pay in-state tuition, tuition paid by a Georgian resident that is far cheaper than out-of-state tuition.
So, for those looking to apply to GSU, the university will automatically consider your application for this waiver, and you have better chances to qualify for one if you submit your apps in early September or as soon as applications open.
The waiver goes by the name of Campus Atlanta Scholarship, which
includes either a 50% or a 100% waiver.

VO: Why do you want to go to the US?
Me: I want to start my bachelor's degree in cinematography and film/video production.
*The VO's facial expression made me understand that he was impressed with the field I wanted to pursue*
VO: Why do you want to study filmmaking? 
Me: Officer I come from a very artistic family, my father, mother, and sister, everyone is into arts, so I've always had a sense of appreciation toward all forms of art...

VO: What kind of art does your father do?
Me: He likes to paint.
VO: Where does your sister live?
Me: I have a younger sister and she lives with us.
VO: What does your father do?

I wish to bring all of the knowledge and techniques of advanced filmmaking to Pakistan so that I could create projects to uplift the under-developing film industry of Pakistan.

VO: Please pass your documents. (She spent a lot of time looking at her screen and my I20.)
VO: Why the US?
(I feel like I fumbled here but I just answered how the US is the best at research and my program and that’s why I want to pursue my masters there at (my uni))
VO: Why (this uni)? (it’s in the top 20 of my grad program, btw)
(I gave my reasons and I also mentioned that I talked to current students and alumni.)
VO: How many people did you talk to?
(I told her about the students I talked to and the staff at uni I talked to, as well as the information seminars I attended.)
VO: Why this course?
(I talked about my major, its application in research, and how im interested in pursuing a career in this field.)
VO: What kind of research?
(I told her the kind of diseases im interested in studying.)
VO: What diseases specifically?
(I told her about the two diseases im interested in researching that are also prevalent in my community.)
[P.S: I had experience managing these diseases as a doctor.]
VO: Where do you work currently?
(I told her my job title in clinical research and my work place)
VO: What do you do in your job exactly?
(I elaborated on my duties in my current job.)
VO: How will this course help you? What kind of career can you have?
(I elaborated on how research is something ive already been involved in since my undergrad years and im continuing that. And I told her the several different jobs I can get here in Pakistan. And how it’s a step up from my current work and job title.)
VO: Where would you find these jobs here (in Pakistan)?
(I told her about the place I want to work at in my city and the person there im interested in working with. I also mentioned my current workplace.)
VO: So you’re a medical doctor?
Me: Yes
VO: When did you graduate?
Me: three years ago
VO: Where did you graduate from?
(I told her my university name.)
VO: Where is this college?
Me: Here in ___ (my city) right next to the ____________hospital.
VO: What did you do since?
(I talked about my jobs since graduating. My intern year and then of course my current job.)
VO: Whos sponsoring you?
Me: My uncle and aunt and a Dean’s scholarship.
(I told her the names of my sponsors, and how the scholarship was merit based.)
VO: What do they do?
(I told her each of their job titles and place of work)
VO: (Again confirmed my uncle’s workplace).
Me: Yes.
(She was typing a lot and looking at something on her screen while I talked about my sponsors)
VO: Do you have any financial documents of your uncle and aunt. Anything I can see now?
Me: Yes, I have their bank statements and affidavit of financial support. Would that be fine?
VO: Yes.
Me: Sorry they have these post-it/tags on them
VO: That’s fine.
Me: Okay here you go. (I also ended up giving both their passport copies)
VO: Oh so theyre separate people, not married to each other?
Me: Oh no no, theyre both separate people, not related.
VO: Where do they live?
Me: My uncle lives here in (my city) at ____ and my aunt lives in ____ (abroad, not US)
VO: (She sifted through everything; the bank statements, my I20, and was carefully reading even the affidavit. I should highlight here that I assume my last two rejections for the B1/B2 visa were because of my finances, which is probably why she was carefully reading everything in my case. Just my opinion.)
VO: Alright I see you have enough for one academic year. What about your second year?
Me: Yes, I have the Dean’s scholarship well into my second year as well, and my uncle and aunt will continue to support me.
VO: Okay.
(Then she was reading through something on the screen. She was doing this a lot during my interview and overall for others too maybe, cause other people were standing idly by her counter as well for a while.)
VO: I see you have previous rejections, was that trip for the USMLE? (many interviewees that day were going for their USMLE Step 3 or clinical rotations, just btw)
Me: Um, not exactly. I was also going for my clinical electives at ______ (this is a top ranked university in the US) where I had the chance to work with Dr ____ and another clinical elective at ______ (a famous research hospital in the US) to work with Dr ____. (I was excitedly telling her about the Drs because I genuinely find them both to be amazing)
VO: Are you not giving USMLE now?
Me: No. As I said, I am not pursuing a clinical career anymore. Im pursuing research.
VO: (I don’t recall the exact question. She asked me to elaborate on my career change. Like why I wasn’t practicing as a medical doctor and why I’m currently pursuing this degree and research?)
(I told her about when I switched and what led me to change my career to research. I just answered honestly.)
VO: How have your circumstances changed since then?
(I got confused because I thought I already elaborated on my career change so I mentioned it again and how this is for a masters degree.)
VO: No, what has changed? Did your sponsors not fund your trip last time?
Me: Oh no, my aunt and uncle weren’t my sponsors then. It was my father. He was sponsoring my trip last time.
VO: What do your parents do?
VO: How come your aunt and uncle are sponsoring you this time? How did that happen? (again, I don’t remember her exact words but she wanted me to elaborate why I made this change and how my aunt and uncle came to be my sponsors this time)
(I explained how they became my sponsors. They have been supportive of me throughout my application cycle and offered to fund my education. And I accepted.)
VO: Okay.
(Then she kept reading something. Kept scanning my passport. Was mostly looking at her screen during my interview. This felt like forever.)
VO: Alright, everything looks okay.
(Now this I was unprepared for, what should I say now lol. Should I say thanks or okay? So I just kept quiet lol)
VO: Im approving your visa! (Then she went on to explain how I will get my passport in 3-5 days, that she will keep my passport but return my I20 and SEVIS page. How I should keep this safe and make sure to bring it with me while travelling for the US Port of Entry I guess. I was in sheer shock so I was just blankly staring)
Me: Thank you! Thank you, hope you have a wonderful day ahead!
Took my documents and my folder and just rushed out.
The interview was longggg, as you can read. My VO was taking long interviews of nearly everyone I could see in that counter but it was not necessarily a bad thing. A lot of them were approved; you just had to be concise in your answers. The length itself can be intimidating, but if you’re honest and you’ve done your homework it will go well inshaAllah.
My brothers were a great source of help for me. They conducted my mock interviews and helped me throughout. One of my brothers is on an F1 visa in the US and I mentioned it in the DS160 form as well. But as you can read, she asked me nothing about that. I even mentioned an uncle in the US in my previous DS160 form for my B1/B2 applications, but she asked nothing about that either.
I reached out to many Pakistani students in the US through friends and friends of friends who all told me about their visa experiences and how it’s so straightforward and nothing to worry about. They were all super supportive and encouraging as well.
I used this group and the F1 visa experiences group on facebook a lot to gauge the kind of questions I could be asked and to learn from other people’s experiences. I made it a point to read mostly the approved posts. The rejected posts, though a lot more in number, serve to discourage and demotivate you. But yes, you can also learn from them. I still suggest reading mostly the approved posts. I even reached out to 
Rana Ibrar
 who was so gracious with his time and advice and guided me. He conducted a mock interview, told me about all possible questions, and was overall very motivating. He basically said: Your visa is approved! Long before I heard it in the consulate lol. JazakAllah Abrar!
Good luck to everyone applying. The 3Cs mentioned in this group’s featured post is spot on, and you will find anyone on the internet saying the same. Your finances, credibility as a student, and your commitment to the course and country and laws is what’s important. Which they will gauge from your interview mostly. If you are a genuine student and your finances are in order you should have no problem getting that visa inshaAllah.

Program: PhD Computer Science (fully funded)
Location: Islamabad Embassy

Interview: 12th June
Interview was scheduled at 9 00 but took place around 12 pm. 
VO asked me the following questions:

University of California, Davis
2- Why this university? 
There are multiple reasons

3- what will you be researching on?
I will be working in program analysis mainly software testing. We will be making open source tools to automate the testing for critical softwares such as browsers and operating system kernels.
4 - Her expression changed upon hearing the word automate, and she stopped typing and said , by automate you mean like AI? 
No, we will be doing it through graphs and different tools, we will be mainly working on rust (a new programming language). (She didn't understand the technical terms but said ohh okay).
{I also had my advisor wrote me a letter stating the research I will be doing , so I told her I also have a letter from my supervisor which states my research, but she said I don't need it).
5- where did you do your undergrad from?
Lahore university of management sciences.
6- do you have a masters degree?
No, I am going after my undergrad, it's a masters leading to a PhD program.
7- what does your father do.
Told he is retired. (I expected the next answer would be about expenses , so I told her my program is fully funded and here's the funding letter - I tried passing her the letter to which she said, yes, I can see that on your I 20.)
8- what are your future plans?
I plan to work in academia. I would like to come back to Pakistan and join my undergrad institute as an Associate professor, a PhD is a a minimum requirement for that - I really enjoy teaching and I worked as teaching assistant for 5 courses during my undergrad - pointed towards my resume as well.
VO started typing and scrolling for like a minute.
9- Do you have any relatives in the US?
No.
She scrolled and type for like 30ish seconds and passed me the blue slip.
Just keep it simple, and causal. Be confident. Take it as a conversation not an interview. Be yourself. 
Best of luck, you got this.

Congrats, I am approving your visa! 
I was shocked at what is happening...
VO already rejected 4 students in front of me after a full detailed interview..
And I want to tell you one thing interesting ... I was in the line where VO was a lady and she was rejecting everyone and rejecting 4,5 students already...When she calls me for an interview I skipped the line...Their security officer asked me why I skip the line?. I said I feel hesitant in front of the lady officer 
...He said okayy and allow me to give my interview to the male Visa officer..
It was quick barely 2 minutes. I was prepared and confident enough. 
Serious suggestion:- Be confident with a smiling face and don't hesitate... VO wants to give VISA if you are confident...
Thanks...

Embassy location: Karachi
Visa status: Approved on 1st attempt alhamdulillah(Arrived in USA on 28th December 2022)
Interviewer was a short haired blondie on counter 3
***PS. The interview was long as I tried to drag it as much as possible, so I will try to write as much as I can remember bear with the long post I hope it can be helpful***
Me: Hello
VO: Hey, how are you?
Me: I am good, I hope you are doing well too.
VO: thank you, May I have your picture
Me: Sure, here you go?
VO: How much time has passed since you got this captured?
Me: Maybe 2 months or a little over I don’t remember exactly.
VO: Is your picture edited?
Me: Oh yes, I guess it is as I got it taken at a studio
VO: Alright, may I have your documents please?
Me: You mean the bundle they made at first security check?
VO: Yeah that’s the one
Me: Here you go!
VO: Thank you (takes a glance at my documents and started typing away on her computer vigorously)
Me: Pleasure is all mine!
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going for higher studies, masters in civil engineering precisely.
VO: (continues typing while asking) Which university did you applied to?
Me: Oh I applied to 4 universities and got accepted at Lamar university
VO: Where else did you applied to?
Me: I applied at 3 other universities *told the names*, I originally planned to go for bridgeford but the communication with them was not so efficient and Lamar had swift responses so I thought why not!
VO: Can you tell me about your bachelors course?
Me: You mean the whole curriculum or the background of what it was about?
VO: Yeah the background (still focusing on her computer)
***BTW a handful tip try to get the interviewers’ attention because that is actually an indication that she is interested in knowing about you and most likely to grant you a visa so stop making robotic internet responses come up with your own originality***
Me: I explained about my bachelors and research major
VO: Ok so who is funding your studies?
Me: Well ofcorse my father is funding my studies as I am a student and I don’t work plus I also was able to get scholarship on merit basis
VO: What does your father do?
Me: He is a businessman
VO: What kind of business he runs?
Me: Oh he rents out heavy machineries for road carpet finish and supplies bitumen.
VO: Sorry, what bitumen?
Me: Uh you know the finish product of the road, small black rocks used for carpeting the roads.
VO: Oh yeah I got that, so why did you chose civil engineering for masters?
(She was continuously typing at this point too and I was trying to drag the convo as much as I can so she can start talking to me actually face to face)
Me: Ok so the story goes way long back, my father supported and encouraged me a lot regarding my education and such as I have no brother he placed all his expectations on me in this regard and trained me for such so that when I grow up I can help him with the business handling and that’s the reason it became my passion to actually learn about what my father does and to help him improve I wanted to learn about it from a worldly aspect so that we can adapt the technology and methods used around the world.
VO: Oh wow that’s cool!
(She glanced at me and started typing away again and I stood there waiting but seconds felt like hours and it felt like the pause was too long so I started talking again)
Me: While doing my thesis I got lucky and my bachelors research preprint got published too which was a milestone for me.
VO: (finally she leave her computer leaned on the table and turned her whole attention towards me and that felt like an achievement at that moment TBH) Tell me more about it.
Me: So my research was about the airport management at Karachi Jinnah Intl Airport and its aspects.
VO: How is airport management related to what you want to study?
Me: Yeah the infrastructure and management aspect you know.
VO: Ohhh now that’s cool, Congratulations your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you!
***She was giving me the yellow approval slip alongwith my documents bundle from the small window and suddenly stopped either ends of the documents in each of our hands***
VO: When does your classes start?
Me: Oh they start from 17th Jan 2023.
VO: Alright you are free to go
(I took the document and went straight outside without seeing back and out where I cam from in)
***Remember you can be nervous it doesn’t matters because the officers are well aware of that no matter how hard you try to hide it it’s just going to get worse so do not bother with that but don’t lose your composure in the process this is the thing you need to work on. Never ever express your gratitudes and emotions and joyness when your visa gets approved as it is going to convey that you are desperate and most highly chance of getting rejected because they can do it that is what they are checking from the very beginning till the end, they are not interested in you because of all those robotic answers they hear all day long so make them actually talk to you, and last but not the least recite some duas for ease all the time on the way to the embassy till you stand in front of the interviewer, don’t think about acception or rejection that’s the main thing and you will automatically start to talk without any hesitation***
That’s all for now if you have any further questions feel free to ring my inbox and best of luck for thise who have upcoming interviews believe in Allah have faith in yourself and ace the interview afterall you are paying a hefty amount just to get to talk with the person and still you have to be nervous from thise who are taking your money, give yourself a prep talk and you are good to go.
Best Regards

VO:- Your fathers business is not showing up . 
( Gives a very scary look) 
Me:- Try *tells the real name*, you would be able to see my father and a couple of reviews. 
( i said something about the name being changed recently or because of the language thingy, I just spewed words I could think of )

2:- Go early, my interview was at 9 30 and I went in at 9 o clock and got into the embassy at 12. 
3:- Get atleast 2 copies of Confirmation letter and your Id card because they take those  before the shuttle service. And if you don’t have these you need to get into the line for photocopy and thats an additional 30 minutes. 
4:- The only options for the shuttle service was 3000 and 5000, and the lady said that I needed to take the premium service because I was getting late.
They try to sell the premium service but it not necessary at all because there is another line outside the embassy. 
5:- Don’t worry about the time , My appointment was scheduled for 9 30 and I was interviewed at 12 15 . 
6:- I had done a mock interview with my college counselor and read a couple of interviews in the group . I read the frequently asked questions mentioned in the post of a Mod. 
Allah Khair krsi.
I’m not an expert but if anybody needs any kind of help feel free to ask .

VO was Asian American
VO: 
Please pass your documents (passport and I20)
VO: Have you been to the US before?
Yes I went there with my family couple of years back.
VO: Why do you want to go now?
I want to pursue a master's degree in xyz program for abc university. 
VO: Why this program?
It is a growing field and related to my undergraduate degree as well as current job. 
VO: Who is your sponsor?
My sponsor is xyz and he has a business based in pakistan. (Gave some details of his business here to avoid usual follow up questions regarding sponsor. 
VO: Your visa is approved. 
The interview was of one minute at max. I had an upper hand because of being a issued a tourist visa earlier but most people were getting accepted that day. 
A few pointers for people who would be applying:
- Aim for universities that have a QS ranking of under 500. 
- Apply to multiple universities (3-5) as it shows the student's interest in studying. 
- Try applying to a field that is related to your current work experience or undergraduate degree. 
All they really see is the student's authenticity and his ability to come back after studies. If they have any doubt about the student staying there or going to earn money, they will reject your visa. 
All the best, may Allah make the process easy for everyone.

Bismillah, Alhamdulillah by the grace of Allah and prayers of my parents my visa has been approved.
Visa interview experiences
Here is the detailed post for all of my interview experiences from 2017 to 2021. 
It 
is going to be a long post so please bear the headache in your stomach while reading. However, I will try to make it short. 
So it all started when I completed my intermediate(HSSC) from Pakistan. I did my IELTS and applied through a consultant at Wichita state university. My score in IELTS was not that good also, I secured admission in a pathway program.  
1st interview experience.
Embassy: Islamabad
University: Wichita state university. 
Course: Pathway+ bachelors in Aerospace engineering. 
Date: I don't remember the exact date but I think it was on the 4th of Feb 2017. 
Vo: Good morning
Me: Good morning mam. How are u?
Vo: Give me ur documents
Me: Handed over my documents to her. 
Vo: Why are you going to us?
Me: I am going to pursue my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering.
Vo: Which uni?
Me: Wichita state uni
Vo: Why this uni?
Me: Told about uni curriculum, professor's research, etc.
Vo: How many unis u have applied to?
Me: 3 and named them.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: Father
Vo: What does your sponsor do?
Me: Told about my father's govt job and rental shops that we own.
Vo: Give me your bank statement?
Me: Gave her
Vo: Educational documents as well..
Me: I handed over all the documents to her. 
Vo took my passport i20 along with those documents which were asked ...
Ok, I am giving you this white sheet for processing ur documents..  means 221(g).
My case was transferred into the administration process where they verify documents I think. I was really happy as 90+% 221g cases are approved. When I left the embassy and check the online status, it was saying refused. I was stunned that how it could be possible that after one hour of my interview, they refused me. Anyhow, after a few days, I got an email to pick up your documents from .... location, I picked up my documents along with 214B sheet. It was really unfair to me as everything was genuine and still, they rejected me.. 
I thought to apply again as I wasn't aware of the reason for rejection. 
2nd interview experience.
Embassy: ISL
University: I applied with the same university and with the same course as it was in my first interview.
Date: It was in March 2017
The visa officer just asked 3 questions.
VO: Which uni?
Me: Wichita state university.
 VO: Have you ever visit any country?
Me: No, never.
The Visa officer handed over me 214b and said I cannot approve your visa, I left the embassy without saying anything.
3rd interview experience. 
Embassy: ISL
University: Same uni and course.
Date: March 2017

After getting 3 rejections, I thought to apply to more universities and I got accepted into 5-6 universities this time. I selected Indiana tech university as I was having a good amount of scholarships. 
4th attempt.
Embassy: ISL
University; Indiana institute of technology with $13000 scholarship.
Course: Bs mechanical engineering without any pathway.
Date: August 2017.
Intake: Fall.
VO: which uni? 
Me: Indiana tech.
Vo: Why you are going for engineering again?
Me: I said, I did intermediate here in Pak but not engineering. 
Vo: which program?
Me: bs mechanical eng.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father is sponsoring me along with this I have secured a 13000$ scholarship from that uni,
Vo: what does your father do?
Me: Same answer. 
Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is written in this paper(214B).
After getting a rejection, I thought to apply again for the Spring intake. 
5th attempt.
Embassy: ISL.
University: Same as it was in 4th attempt.
Date: 31 November 2017
Intake: Spring.
Vo: Where are you going?
Me: Fort Wayne biggest city of Indiana state,
Vo: Can I explain the changes in my profile?
Vo: no thanks,
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: Father 
Vo: What does he do?
Me: same as I used to speak for my sponsor in previous interviews.
Vo: I cannot approve your visa. 
Me: Thanks.
It was my fifth attempt and had wasted almost two years for the same. I can apply for Australia or Uk at that time, my brain was saying to apply in other countries and my heart was like no no you should go to the USA as it has been my biggest wish to get a USA visa and study over there. 
Anyways, I decided to complete my bachelor's here in Pakistan and apply again for my master's study in the states. 
I completed my bachelor's degree in October 2020 with a 3.7 CGPA.
I took the Duolingo test(alternate of IELTS due to Covid days) and scored 130. Right after completing my bachelor's, I applied to 4 universities with the help of Asim Sahab(my career counselor) Depaul University, Saint Louis University, Oregon state university, and I got accepted in all of them with partial scholarships for spring intake 2021. 
After getting admits, I thought why not apply to some well-ranked university. I dropped off my plans for Spring intake 2021 and applied to Northeastern University(Ranked under top 50 universities nationally according to US News ranking) by myself with the help of Zaryab(A great friend of mine). I got admit from it for the fall intake 2021.
After getting i20, I applied for an appointment from US embassy ISL. I got an appointment for 13th July. 
6th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 13/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
It took almost 1 hour I believe by going through the routine process from shuttle service to embassy.
I wasn't aware of that bald guy who was famous for rejections. Unfortunately, I had to give my interview to the same VO. He rejected a student before me.
Me: Good morning.
VO: No reply.
Vo: Can you pass me your documents?
Me: Sure.
Vo: Let's take fingerprints first. 
Me: I did the same and asked if it is done?
Vo: Yeah.
Me: Cool.
Vo: Why are you going to the US?
Me: I am going to us to pursue my master's in project management from Northeastern University, Boston. 
Vo: Why did you choose this school?
Me: I asked him to repeat the question as his voice was not clear.
Vo: He repeated the question.
Me: Besides its ranking that comes under the top 50 schools nationally according to US news ranking I choose NEU due to its course curriculum that offers different electives, workshops and a capstone project,  (Vo interrupted me)
Vo: Who is paying for your trip?
Me: Father.
Vo: What does he do?
Me: I was explaining about my father job and business( He interrupted again)
Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is mentioned in this paper(yellow sheet, here he handed me two yellow sheets, I was like o bhai mere pas dher laga huwa yellow sheets ka already 
 )
Me; thanks and left the embassy with a shattered heart as I was really prepared for this attempt and made many changes in my profile this time. Anyhow, I decided to reapply as It seems unfair to me without knowing the reason he rejected me even he was not listening to my answers. 
I did not bother to change anything in my profile as I did not exactly know the reason for rejection. 
7th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 30/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
Before me, one student visa got approved who got rejected previously and the visa officer asked him what changes he made in his profile he said no changes as he was not confident last time and now he is. He got his visa approved. 
after that student officer asked me to move forward.
Me: good morning how are you doing?
Vo: He said good thank you,
Vo: I see you have been refused already so what changes do you bring out this time?
Me: I don’t feel to make any changes in my profile since I have gotten admission to a highly ranked university in USA with a course curriculum that is perfectly aligned with my future plans of Pakistan, 
After listening to that he was continuously seeing his computer screen, I guess he must be checking my previous interview experiences,
After a few minutes, he told me I cannot approve your visa the reason is the same as before, 
I said is it permanent rejection as this is my 7th attempt, 
He said, you have too many rejections and you need to change the circumstances. 
I left the counter.
I thought to change my sponsor and added my mother as my sponsor in my DS160. I thought to try changing sponsor so maybe it could work. 
8th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 11/08/2021 / 10:15 Am
VO was a big beard guy with his 50-55. 
Me: Hi sir, how are you doing?
VO: good morning, can you please scan your fingerprints.
I did, then VO told me to pass my documents. 
VO: what is the purpose of your trip?
Me: I am going to us to pursue master's in project management from northeastern uni, Boston.
VO: who will bear the expenses?
Me: My parents.
VO: What do they do?
Told about the parent business and job. In the end I said, we have a savings of 52k$. Do you want to see the bank statement?
VO: no, not needed.
VO: Have you ever visited any country?
Me: No, I never visited any country.
VO: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Me: Yes I do have.
VO: what do they do?
Me: One of my brothers is a chemical engineer and working as senior chemical eng in service industries, other siblings are still studying.
Then he started typing and after 30-45 seconds he said, Us laws are really strict and I cannot approve your visa.
I said, sir, is there anything wrong with my profile as this is my 8th attempt for f1 visa? 
VO: there is nothing wrong with your profile and you did not change anything in your profile.
I said I have changed my sponsor this time as I added my mother to my sponsor list.
VO: sorry.
I said thank you and left the counter.
After this attempt, I decided to change my university and reapply again.  I was also thinking to change the embassy but dropped off this plan as in my point of view embassy does not matter at all. 
I deferred my admission to Depaul university to spring intake 2022 and applied for the i20. I got an electronic i20 at the end of august and paid the fee again for the appointment.

Vo was a really great guy in his 50+. Before me, the visa of one girl got approved. Luckily, I did not see the bald guy there and there were two VO's that were taking the interviews. I observed they were approving visas for most of the candidates. I was the last one being interviewed in the embassy. My visa interviews went smoothly. 
Me: Good morning officer, how are you doing?
Vo: Hi, good.
Vo: Fingerprints, I said is it done? , he said yeah. 
Vo: So, Mr.... you were there before uhmm..... He scanned my DS160.
Me: Yes, my visa has been refused 3 times this year. I want to say something. Actually, last time visa officer told me to change something in my profile and reapply. Now, I have changed my university with a more popular and advanced STEM degree that has a promising career in Pakistan. My intentions are to get my master's degree from the USA and come back to Pakistan to work as a business analyst in one of my dream companies that is Nestle. 
Vo: hmmm...
Vo: He was seeing the previous visa officer's comments on his screen, he got up and went back to talk with someone, I guess he was speaking about the visa officer who had rejected me before. He made some funny comments with his colleague and smiling.
Vo: So, you have applied to this embassy?
Me: Yes, I have applied to the ISL embassy. 
Vo: Have you ever applied to the KHI embassy?
Me: No, never. 
Vo: He scanned my ds160 3-4 times. I don't know why. He then wrote down his comments. After some time, Ok Mr.... you are good to go, your visa has been approved and you will get your passport within 5 days. He returned back i20, ds160, blue sheet(Approval sheet) and put my passport in the basket.
Me; Thanks, officer, thank you so much. 
Vo: Have a nice stay in the states while smiling. 
Me: Inside me( yeah yeah buddy why not).
I was literally crying when I was leaving the embassy, it was like a dream come true for me. 
I would like to thanks a few members of this group who helped me a lot during my interview experiences.

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Status: Approved, received passport in three days.
Date: April 13, 2022
Consulate/Embassy: Islamabad.
Major and University: Bachelor’s in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts Amherst.
My interview was scheduled for 11 AM, but I got to the Embassy at around 8 AM and the guards allowed me to enter early. I was out of the embassy by 9:15-ish. The interview itself only lasted 3 minutes.
I was asked the following questions:
1: What’s your major.
2: Why did you choose this university.
3: How many did you apply to.
4: Show me your scholarship letter.
5: What does your father do.
6: How much land does your father own.
7: Has he ever travelled outside Pakistan.
8: Have you travelled outside Pakistan in the last five years.
9: What do you intend to do after the degree.
The only thing the VO saw was my admissions letter with scholarship (14,000 USD per year, and funding from my father is 45,000 USD).
There are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about the Visa process here.
If you can:
1: Establish yourself as a genuine student;
2: Show concrete proof of funding;
3: Convince the VO you will return to Pakistan,
You will NEVER be denied the Visa.
1: Establishing yourself as a genuine student:
One of the best — or maybe the only way — to convince the VO that you’re a genuine student is to apply and get accepted to top public or private universities. I applied to 16 public colleges (all top 100 for my major) and I was accepted to 13, Alhumdulillah. There is no such thing as a “visa ratio”; as long as your university is highly ranked for your major, and is selective, you’ll get the visa.
My advice: Please do not hire consultants to apply to universities on your behalf. They only have very low ranking universities that will negatively impact your chances of getting a Visa.
2: Proof of funding:
It’s very important to convince the VO that you/your sponsor can fund at least a full year of living and tuition in the States. My VO did not even ask to see my bank statements, and that was probably because I told her what my father did, and that I had received more scholarships from other universities but ultimately chose UMass because it had a better ranked program — UMass did not offer me the highest scholarship from my list. This convinced the VO that my father can, indeed, fund my stay in the States.
3: Strong ties to home country:
Convince the VO that your entire family is in Pakistan and — if your father owns a business — tell them that you’ll inherit the business. This is usually ample proof.
Also, English speaking skills and confidence go a LONG way. I believe my interview was so short because I was speaking English very naturally and confidently. Which may be why the VO did not even ask for more documents.
I understand that a lot of applicants may not be able to speak English fluently, and I would strongly advise them to invest in English speaking classes at least three months before the interview. If you’re not going for a language program, it’s imperative to have a strong grip on English.

VISA APPROVED
Date: 19thMay 2023
Program: PhD in Engineering Education (Fully funded)
University: State University of New York at Buffalo
location: US Embassy Islamabad
VO 
was a middle aged lady with glasses
Me: Good Morning Officer (Meanwhile I had already passed my passport, I 20, SEVIS and DS-160)
VO: Good Morning. Is it your first time here?
Me: Yes, I have never been here before.
VO: So where are you going?
Me:  I plan to go to SUNY Buffalo for my PhD in Engineering Education and it is a fully funded offer with an assistantship.
VO: How did you come to know about this PhD?
Me: Well the desire to do my PhD in this field stemmed from my surroundings. Throughout my educational and professional career, I noticed that Engineering is considered to be male dominant field. Somewhere deep down I wanted to change that and for this exact reason I plan to do my research in “Diversity and inclusion in Engineering education”.  (I was not interrupted at all by VO so I kept on talking). Although PhD in this field is being offered by other US universities as well but I chose this university cuz I had read a few research papers of Prof xyz so I dropped  her an email expressing my interest to work with her to which she replied then we had a zoom a session and she agreed to supervise me provided I can get myself admitted by meeting the requirements of graduate school. I then applied at uni portal and not only did I get admitted but I was also offered a full scholarship.
That was a long answer but I just did not wanna stop until I was interrupted so I kept going.
VO:  So you have assistantship?
Me: Yes I do have it.
VO: So what exactly would you do in your research?
Me: There would basically be 3 major research questions and then went on to state all 3 of them.
VO: Tell me how as a male you came to realize the underrepresentation of women in engineering?
Till now, VO would ask me a question and then would start typing on the computer and would occasionally make an eye contact. But after asking this question, she took both her hands off keyboard and placed on the table as if she was very eager to listen to my answer.
Me:  When I was doing my bachelors, there were only 2 girls in a class of 50 people. During the fours years of my professional career, there was only a handful of representation of female members of the society and even those who were there, they would put in a resign after sometime. So I always had it in back of my hand that if we are not taking measures to make our educational institutes diverse and inclusive then we would have to bear severe economical repercussions.
VO: Do you have bachelor's in STEM?
Me: Yes, I did my bachelor's in electronics engineering.
VO: Which school would you be joining in UB?
Me: School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
VO kept typing for few seconds and then out came the golden words. Your visa is approved and she handed me over the blue slip.
Well in my view giving confident answers by maintaining  eye contact with the VO does make a massive difference. VO did not ask for anything from me not even my own CV. The other thing is being proactive in the interview can pass you off as someone who knows what he is doing.

Me: ok thank you.
THE TRICK IS to be Confident and natural like these questions don’t even matter and don’t get stuck while speaking. Try to stay to the point and not give a comeplete story for every answer you give.
My Experience: I came alone to a place near the embassy to stay. At 1 am I realized My mother hadn’t signed my I-20 I forgot to tell her to sign it.
My friend photostated my I-20 from the call center I worked at and delivered it to my home. 
At 2 am my parents left from Peshawar to give me the signed form. Then they asked to drop me off even tho it was just 5:30, I agreed and found out The roads were blocked and we had to take a long route.
I found out no InDriver no careem no Uber were available at the time. So it was a miracle my family came to drop me off. 
If I hadn’t forgotten to sign my form, my family wouldn’t have had come to drop me off and there’s a chance I would have messed things up 
But Thanks to Allah almighty things worked out.
Moral of the story if it’s written for you it will happen if it’s not Allah has better plans for you. Try try again
Best of Luck everyone May Allah bless us All

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Embassy: Islamabad
Status : Approved
Applied by myself
After greeting, VO said my name and I nodded in response
Why are you going to US
I'm going for studies
You're going to Harvard. Great. What are you going to study?
Differential equations
Differential equations?
Yes, my concentration is differential equations although it says liberal arts on the document.
Why do you want to study these?
I'm a teacher and need to learn them so I can teach it to my students.
How was the application process?
(VO was asking about admission application and I thought he meant visa application) Most people said I should get an advisor or counsellor but I did it myself, didn't find it very complicated.
(VO interrupted) 
Did you apply and get accepted for it or just signed up?
I had to apply and go through the admission process.
OK. How do you plan to pay for it?
From my savings.
How much  do you have?
I shared the amount.
Are you married?
Yes
Any kids?
No.
Is your wife going with you?
No she's not. (I wanted to explain why, but didn't)
Have you changed your name before?
No, I haven't.
OK. It says you were Akmal (not real name) before?
My family calls me that endearly. It hasn't been my official name. 
OK I'm approving your visa. You'll get your passport in some days.
I asked how long it will take and he said its on the blue slip.
VO kept typing throughtout these questions and there were long pauses between questions. He didn't ask me for any supporting documents apart from the usual sevis fee, visa fee, DS 160 and Passport.
I was very nervous because he refused 3 people before me and only one approval. At the last minute I told myself that this person is a gatekeeper and I have to go to US nomatterwhat. I focused on why I was there and where I wanted to be, instead of focusing on people around me. Confidence is key. He could have refused me for my ans to last question but I clarified and was confident which I think helped.
ایسا لگ رہا ہے جیسے برسوں کا بوجھ ہٹ گیا ہو۔ 
I was refused visa for UK 4 years ago despite having an offer from University of Cambridge and it took me 3 years to save the money for this program.
I'd like to thank Tahir Haneef for helping me clear my doubts and for questions I had. I'd also like to thank you all for this group and the moderators. I did multiple mock interviews using different questions from previous posts here.
BTW nobody tells you about the whole gruesome process of going to shuttle stop, the exorbitant fee for it, multiple queues and security checks. The embassy building is daunting. Also, from the moment I stepped out of embassy to until I left the shuttle stop, every person I met asked me for mithayi after seeing the blue slip. I hope our workers learn some self respect and stop the begging.

University: Cleveland State University
Sponsor: Cousin living in the US
Embassy: Islamabad
Interview date: 03 Aug 2022
Passport received: 20 Sep 2022
Interview experience: VO only asked about my program and current job while constantly typing. He was not asking anything else but just typing, I was telling him about my graduation, sponsor and future goals. He was just saying OK in reply. He then told me he will need some more information via email and returned my passport.
So, i want to share my experience what observed so far, it might be helpful for someone.
First and the most important thing is the believe in Allah and Duas from parents.
Practice interview in front of a mirror or laptop camera.
Prepare the answers to common questions from VO and analyze them until you get confidence that they are according to your case because only you know the best about yourself. Tell him like a story and show your accomplishments. No doubt, university and sponsorship matter but the most important thing that matters is how you are presenting your case if it makes sense then all OK. Your whole profile matter.
One last important thing which we often ignore, please be dressed as it depicts how serious you are about your study or the concerned post. They judge you from the very moment when you get up from the chair and move towards the window.
Best of luck all.
Thanks!

Thanks.
Important points you should consider before applying for the F1 visa.
1)If you going for studies in the USA then you have to do the entire process without the support of any consultant, otherwise, your visa will be rejected.
2)You have to be very confident while you are communicating with the visa officer.
3) Your dress matters a lot, always prefer to wear simple and dark-colored clothes for the visa interview.
4)Always try to work on your grooming if you are planning for the visa interview (Beard, Hair Cut, Hair Colour, and Clean Shave) Everything should be up to date.
5) Try to keep a smile on your face while giving the interview.
6) If you do not know how to apply to a US university or even how to apply for a visa then you have to select the other country, USA is not the right place for you. Your input really matters.
7) Stop giving answers in YES or NO (Your answer should be at least one line).
Thank you so much Rana Ibrar and Mahwish Moazzam for your continuous effort and support. That was impossible without your assistance. God Bless you.

Interview date = 15 Aug
Status = approved 
V.O= long beard man
Time slot = 10.30 am
First Question = how many admits you got
Answer = i got admission in 3 out of 4 universities in which i applied. Unfortunately wasn’t able to make it to university of rochester. Also named the universities and their business schools in which i got admit
2nd = why this xyz university 
Ans= Told MSBA at xyz is ranked among top 100 MsBa programs in the world according to Qs rankings. Also told in detail about the diversity of curriculum 
3rd= how many brothers you have
Ans = told 1 and also about his profession
4Th= who is financing you
Ans= told i have got scholarship of about 5K and have personal savings of around 8k and the rest of cost which is almost 43 k is going to be paid by my father. 
He asked about his business and i gave him the details 
5th= he asked me about my mother’s sister who lives in US
Ans= i told him that i have no immediate relative but about other relatives I already had mentioned in my Ds-160. He didn’t bother about it because she lives in different state than the state in which I have got acceptance..
Conclusion = 
Before the start of interview i had got the confidence that I would get visa because VO gave quite time to a student before me and listened him comprehensively before rejecting his visa so i got the feeling that if he gives me that chance i ll have the chances to get the visa. No doubt it is game of luck . And also the VO who is quite young was also giving alot of opportunity to speak . Women VO had more interviews from non-F1 categories and she put most of these cases to administration processing

Sorry for the delayed post. 
I got my visa Approved on the 15th of August. Got my Passport after 15 days.
Islambad Embassy
The Officer was Long beard Guy.
Indiana Institute of Tech
The interview was pretty quick and straightforward.
Who is your sponsor?
Father's business?
How many branches?
How many Employees?
Why Gap?
Have you been to the U.S before?
Is it an Online Institution?
That was about it I guess If I remember correctly. I just wanted to post here because I used to read people's stories and get inspired to an extent so I thought it was my obligation to do the same.
There are no tricks Guys. Just know your stuff.
Read as much as possible about your course, your university, your Gap if any, and your sponsor's business (how many employees, the total income etc). The more you read about your stuff the more confident you will be.
Just be confident, be fluent. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's going to a 2-3 minutes interview that will change your life. 
One more thing, don't think about 2nd attempt. Consider your first attempt the last one and get the visa.
Good Luck!

Visa refused (weak ties to home country)
Responses:
Why this university 
There are a couple of reasons for choosing this uni, it is offering me modules like international political economy that no other college in my list offered which directly aligns with my future plans. 
Other than that its location was a major attraction for me, as depaul is in center of Chicago, chicago is very diversified hence I can gain alot of cultural exposure which will further bolster my education.
Lastly, it gave me a generous amount of scholarship
Who is sponsoring you?
My father, what does he do(told)
How many employees in his company?
25-30 
What other schools did you apply to?
I applied top liberal arts schools in uk&usa.
Why did you choose this uni over them?
It had a better sub courses, and offered me more scholarship. 
Can anyone tell me where did I go wrong?

Status refused 6th March
My interview lasted for 10 minutes atleast everything was going in order. I dont know what is the reason of my  refusal. Experts please tell me what should i do now.
Me. Good morning
Vo. No reply. Give me your i20 and passport
Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world. Degree obtained from usa has much more worth then any of other countries here in pakistan. They also offer practicle courses, flexible education and cultural diversity further enhanced the educational experience. 
Vo. what are you going to study
Me. I going to peruse masters of cyber security.
vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.
Vo. Sory, we can not approve your visa this time and gave me slip.
Experts please tell me where did I go wrong.

Master of science in computer Science from University of the pacific. 
In my first attempt, they asked me only four questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I applied again a 4 days after my first attempt. 
ME: Good morning Officer,
VO: Good Morning, 
VO: Why you are going to the USA? 
ME: Officer I am going to pursue my master's in Computer Science.
VO: okay so why going to study there?
Me: USA has the highest Academic standard, also they have more hands on practice learning. Apart from this graduating from a USA university can lead me to the senior level job in pakistan.  
VO: Ahaan, So where are you currently working?
Me: I am working as a ******* Engineer at (Company name) 
VO: Sorry as a? 
ME: Told my position, and company name again. 
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Told detailed of skills i worked.
VO: How did you applied for this university?
ME: Officer, I applied for total four universities, and I applied through websites. 
VO: Which universities you applied to?
ME: Told all four universities name.
VO: Where is ******** university?
ME: told the city name, after saying it I smiled and said officer at this time even I don’t remember the exact location but it's situated in this city. 
VO: Smiles and said Even i have also heard the university name first time 
So, where is university of the pacific i haven’t heard that as well. 
ME: Officer, it's in Stockton, California even though they have their three campuses and told the other cities name. And i am going to Stockton campus.
VO: Ohh, okay.

ME: I said No mam, we are not affected so much then other these areas (stated other cities name)
VO: Okay. 
Then asked me about my brothers and what they do. Also Asked anyone relative in the USA.
After few minutes typing on computer officer gave me pink slip that your visa is approved. 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that it's very hard to get cleared in second attempt but never loose hope and stay calm. 
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!
"
210,"
Hi guys, My visa was refused on 31 Jan the worst day of my life. I was not expecting that I was sure that I am a genuine student and that my profile is so strong my visa will not be refused but it is. I went into depression and couldn't even talk to my parents for a few days then I decided I am not gonna try again. I should switch to Australia and apply there. And I was scared that maybe my Australian visa will be refused because my USA visa is refused. I contacted many 
consultants they said It's not a big deal. I asked a few questions in this group and came to know that it's not a big deal many students got visas on the second attempt. So I gathered information from everyone and came to the point I should try again for the USA. because if my Australian visa is refused there will be no chance that my USA visa will be approved. So I defer my semester to fall 2023. So I want to know from you guys What I should change to my application?
Should I change university? All other students who applied to that uni got visa approval, not even a single one got a refusal.
Should I add another sponsor along with my father?
Those guys who got approval after rejection please tell me what you guys did.
Lastly, I want to tell you to say your interview did not go well which may be the reason. But my interview lasted for 15 minutes and I answered everything. But when I posted my experience in this group I realized that I made 1 to 2 mistakes but that's not a reason for refusal.

Hello everyone
One of my friend and me appeared in islamabad consulate on 14 April with regular appointment instead of previously refused.No one questioned us on this and we saw no.of students with regular but i have seen a post in this group a student got refused by karachi consulate because of using regular appointment.
I don’t think officer have any problem with your appointment category and give refusal on the basis of appointment category because they don’t know about this 
and they never asked for appointment confirmation slip on interview counter.
Anyone here who used regular appointment in karachi consulate without any problem instead of previously refused?

Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

Date: 14th October 
Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

3rd Interview for F-1 
Status: Refused 
When 
I reached to visa officer, she scanned my passport and said Oh! You applied twice in December 2022? 
Me: Yes, 
VO: okay, what did you change in your profile/application? 
Me: I changed my way of confidence and i am prepared this time for Interview. In my last 2 visa interviews I was not much confident and did not deliver the satisfactory answers and spoiled the whole interview session. 
VO: what universities did you applied and why you applied only in those universities and why you chose this university. Me: told the universities names where I applied, and told her When I was searching on internet the best university in the US for MS Marketing with concentration of Data mining USF was on the top of the list then I researched more about the university and found out it is alligned with what I was looking for!! 
VO: why this course? Me: allow me few minutes elaborate my whole situation, as you can see in my DS160 my previous education is engineering, when I joined the company where I am currently employed I got a chance to work with their marketing and I found my hidden skills of marketing. After working and more with the marketing team my interest in this field increased but I observed myself there are still some gaps which needs to be filled and this course will help me to fill those gaps. During the session the VO was countinuously reading what was written on her computer screen instead of typing, I think she was reading notes dropped by previous visa officers on my application. 
VO: sorry, you can not qualify for US visa because you did not change anything in your profile/application.
Me: what do I need to change? 
VO: you have to change your application
Me: Okay, thanks. I left the counter.

Interview experience.
VO: Good morning pass me your i-20 and passport.
Me. 
Good morning. yes sure
VO. Why do you want to get higher studies?
Me. Well, my father is a teacher and he teaches me basic mathematics in my school. He developed my interest in mathematics and support me in my higher studies. I got a silver medal in MSc and also did my MS from a top-ranked university in Pakistan. And now I want to be a professor after getting Ph.D.
VO. What are you doing since your last degree? (I didn't understand what he said and didn't ask VO to repeat the question).
Me. (I didn't remember what I answered.)
VO. What are you doing now?
Me. I have been teaching in a higher secondary school since April 2019.
VO. Have you visited the US before?
Me. No, I haven't.
VO. Why you are not doing PhD in Pakistan?
Me. I completed my master's from NUST Islamabad which is a top-ranked university in Pakistan. So I don't have a better option after getting MS from NUST. I have received offers from different countries but all of those offers were without funding. During this time I got an opportunity to study in the US with funding, and I accepted this offer.
VO. I can not issue a visa this time. Thank you.
During the interview, VO looks at my i-20 almost 4 times.
(I prepared my interview well. But didn't answer a single question I prepared. I don't know what happened at that time.)

Hello guys! Need help to decide this. My previous 2 visas were refused for Purdue University MSBA at Islamabad Embassy. From interviews, I gathered that my financials were the apparent reason for refusal since I have a student loan. 
I am working on showing complete balance in the bank statement for third attempt. I have an I-20 from Southern Methodist University MSBA with a good amount of scholarship. 
1. 
Should I change my university in the next attempt and would it be a problem since SMU is a downgrade from Purdue? 
2. Would it help at all if I choose Karachi for the next interview? 
3. Can people get in touch or comment who got their F1 visa in 3rd or 4th attempt? Any tips?

Me: Because I wanted to explore the market of embedded system so that later in pakistan i can have a great business out of it. When i did research , i  figured out that US is on the top of list and has a great embedded system market  then i thought what can be better than this studying within USA. So I chose USA for my study.

VO: And which universities?
Me: I applied to North Eastern, Dayton, Texas Tech and IIT.

Me: No, i also got admission from Dayton but for computer science not for Electrical engineering program that i wanted to do, yet  they have not told me their decision for my application of electrical engineering.
VO: Then why not Dayton? (in loud voice with reactive face )
Me: Because I wanted to do masters in electrical engineering with specialization in embedded system and yet they have not told me their decision for my application of electrical engineering so that's why I chose IIT.

Is there anyone who got a rejection after Administrative Processing (221g)? Will they notify by email that your visa is rejected?
I have given interview in Karachi Consulate on April 28, 2022 and since then status was ""Refused"" and the date stated of last update was April 28, 2022 but today I checked again and it still says ""Refused"" but date of last updated changed to July 14, 2022. I got no email.
So I am confused that my visa is still under administrative processing or is it refused.

I’ve been refused twice for F-1 visa. I don’t know what VO is looking for. Please guide the following:
-> Should I change my university this time?
My university in previous attempts was SIUE (with 8K/year) scholarship. I’ve been accepted in Purdue Northwest (without scholarship) too, should I go with SIUE  or change it to Purdue?
-> 
My uncle were my sponsor in previous attempts. Now my principal sponsor is my father. (Circumstances changed)
Please guide what should I do as I’m a genuine student with a good profile but still they are refusing me. Should I only go with changed sponsor or should I change university too?

Hello there! 
My visa was rejected twice in 2021(transfer student) when i was still in 5th semester of my University doing bachelors. Now I've completed my undergrad in 2022 and have an year experience with Toyota in my field. 
Should I reapply for MS/MBA. Seeing that I wasn't granted visa two times, will the VO make sure i don't get it third time? 
I have property and apartments on my name. I run a business too and have a full time job. 
Need 
some guidance, Kindly. 
I'm highly confused. 
Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

Anyways, didnt apply to US again after this and applied for canada through SDS and i got accepted.
If you dont get accepted in US in the first try, rather than begging them in 2nd or 3rd try for a visa , just change your country because some of us are not born with silver spoons in our mouth , nor have any businesses to show ties.

Visa Rejection and Approvals (F-1) 
Dear community, 
I have received 3 F visas in the past with no rejections. I have noticed people sharing their profiles and asking why those that have gotten visas think they were rejected. So with that, please take my advice as it suits you. 
1) 
Are you a genuine student? 
You should ask this question to yourself because life in US is not what is shown in Hollywood movies. Life is very challenging there and you being a genuine student means not increasing more issues for yourself. You can’t just change statuses easily, you can’t just start working there, you can’t just marry there, all these who create this illusions in your mind are not truthful. If your intent is to not study than do not consider applying for F visas. 
2) Can you really pay for a university that’s not offering you any scholarship?
With how the economy is of Pakistan, VO knows real well whether you will be able to pay or not. Don’t think you can just work there and pay for Tuition, health insurance, food, rent, bills, and save. You can’t do that on a 20 hour job. Also, it’s hard in a lot of universities now to get jobs and you can’t work off campus, so plan very very carefully. Don’t get yourself in that mess where you are stuck! If you can’t pay for your Tuition don’t lie about it. If you know your parents won’t be able to pay don’t get yourself in a bad shape. It’s better to go a little later with a better financial package than trying to hurry and than being in bad shape.
3) Getting rejected and immediately running for the next appointment 
Mainly those of you that get rejected are getting rejected on showing weak ties. You can’t just suddenly improve your ties in a week. Don’t rush the situation. Give yourself time to see what went wrong, is it really the university or is it that it was pretty obvious during interview that you won’t be able to pay as you say you will be or you were caught in a lie. Don’t underestimate the ability of VO to know about the circumstances. They are really good at scanning people, that’s what they do all day everyday. So lying about a situation will only get you refusals. When you get refused don’t panic and run for the next available appointment. Try to see what you can change depending upon what went wrong in your interview. 
4) Stay away from consultants! 
Applying for US visa and universities is pretty easy. It’s getting a good financial package is what’s difficult. So stay away from consultants!! They mostly are there to drain your money! I got three F visas and never went to a consultant. 
5) keep faith in yourself 
I know it’s easier for me to say that. But, losing faith in yourself will only put you in worst shape than what you are in. Always know, there are tons of places around the world where you can go study. One country is not what will define your future. Always take a step back and try applying to other countries. You might be able to get a really good package somewhere else. So don’t drain yourself emotionally or mentally! 
I hope this helps those who have been rejected and those that will apply in near future

I was rejected for this upcoming fall semester. 
To improve my application, I need to find a good ranked university.
The MS programs I am looking for are
Data science
Data analytics
Business Analytics
Computer science
Unfortunately my CGPA was 2.95. But I have a over 2 years of relevant work experience. Hence looking for names where i can get accepted with the CGPA and without mandatory GRE.
After my research many universities are saying that they might consider, but they usually don't. Had the same experience last term alot of money was wasted on application fees.
I will be very thankful if someone suggest me good universities with good rank for the spring semester.

Ans= I had previously done BBA from Lahore and now wish to study abroad for a global mindset, specially in a metropolitan city. So I searched for MBA program on Masters portal amd filtered my search for New York. (VO said Ok). I found a bunch of high ranked universities and then studied their ranking and course structure (VO said Ok as if it was enough) and this university matched my requirements. (Again Ok). Also,... (I was speaking in my flow but I realized that he had basically stopped me at this point. So I said Ok and stopped).
He asked me to go back and sit.
After some time I was taken into a seperate room where a Pakistani consular came and talked to me in Urdu.
I greeted him and he straight forward started like consider this a chance for yourself. I kept on agreeing with a smily face until he asked me which consultant did you use? I disagreed and told him that I had done everything by myself. However,  I have seeked some help from a friend as in discussions but nothing else. He continued this interogation for quite some time but my answers remained the same. He told me that I had matching profile with a lot of other candidates and that he has been dealing with them regularly. In fact, a lot of stidents with the same profile had come earlier and agreed that they used a consultant. I told him that a friend of mine has also come here with me and we have discussed things together if that is what you are looking for. But he remained insisting that there were many and that they've agreed to a consultant. I never agreed and he let me out and after some time, I got my passport back with white slip(214B).rejected.
Previously, my friend (whose appointment was at 8 15) was also interogated but for a longer duration than me. He claims that they showed him the exact location of the consultancy on computer screen. This did not happen with me nor he showed any other proof.
Also, I'd like some suggestions if I should go again with the same profile or change university and then apply for the next intake (January)? I'd really like to go in this intake but not sure if I'll be rejected again since I can't change my uni at this point!

Interview Advice for those who got rejected in first Attempt.
You may go with the same university but not with the same profile. VO will must ask you what circumstances have you change this time?
Circumstances mean ur academic, professional, financial or personal circumstances…University is not ur circumstance. 
Try to identify the reason of rejection, improve ur profile accordingly and then apply again with a gap of minimum one month for next attempt for same intake
Re-apply 
with no change in ur circumstances would be a waste of time and money.

Could someone please explain why my visa was rejected? I have provided the entire conversation below for reference.
VO Identity : Long beard Man 
Location : Islamabad 
Question: Why did you choose MIU or why MIU?
Me: MIU is economical and I can afford it easily right now. I am trained in banking software development, and there are only 32 of us who know the banking software development technology. Their course focuses on Oracle JAVA (Banking software development), which I have 
been working on for 5 years, making it beneficial for my career. My current company has committed to promoting me to a managerial position if I complete an MS in Java, so it is a great opportunity for me. He says ""Wow, great.""
Me: If you want to see it, I have a commitment letter from my company. He says ""No need.""
Me: Additionally, MIU's curriculum involves studying only one subject and taking exams at the end of each month. Also, MIU offered us CPT.
Question: I saw on your F1 Form you need $. Who will pay this fee?
Me: Sir, I am on self-finance. It's my savings, and if I need more for the next year, my father is a landlord, and he will easily pay this fee.
Question: How many universities have you applied to?
Me: Four (Drake Uni, MIU, and Mississippi Uni).
He: And which university has selected you?
Me: Drake and MIU.
He: Then why didn't you choose Drake?
Me: Actually, MIU responded first, so I continued my process with MIU.
Question: In your DS_160, I see you already did MSCS. Then why do you want to start MS again?
Me: Sir, actually, I already told you that I have been working on Java for 5 years, and my MS was in Data Science. There is no future for data science in Pakistan, so I want to start MS again, but in Java.
then he start typing completely silence  for 2 mints then i startd talking
additionally sir,  I follow Dr. abc on Google Scholar. I have published six papers internationally, so his research papers are relevant to my research, and if my visa application is approved, I'll work with him in the future.
Question: In which field did you publish your research papers?
Me: Data Sciences.
And then he gave  me a yellow rejection paper.

Counter 7 Young American guy without beard
Students before me for undergraduate programs were rejected and one student for masters degree was accepted only. 
Me: Good Morning officer!
Him: Why this course?
Me: I chose bs business administration as i belong to a business related family, my father and brother both are successful businessmen, i have interest in business as this course will enhance my business skills as ill learn about all aspects of business including economics, marketing, supply chain and information system 
He gave a smile, seemed like he thought i was confident abt my program like know how, and stood up took my passport inside and came back
Him:Why this university?
 I did an internship at an educational consultancy where i got to know about university of UTAH then i did my research and got to know about unique majors that university is providing and big campus situated in 1526 acres, diversification of students, support system for students, i got scholarship of 35000$ across 4 years and last factor was location, which is salt lake city, it is one of the liveable cities in US and top preference for international student because of the business opportunities.
Passed me my docs with rejection slip and said sorry you’re not eligible for the visa under section 214B. 
Can anyone guide me where i went wrong as I cant seem to understand with only two questions how he rejected me. My D160 was perfect also funding and my family ties are also good as I’ll have to come back to takeover my family business. 
Ps: i applied on basis of my o level grades

Greetings and handed over my documents 
VO: Which course are you going for?

I have picked it due to a number of reasons, It was recommended to me by my Company's Director MR XYZ as he was their Alumni and he spoke very highly of them. I have also worked with one of their faculty members in computer science for my final year project for data training and AI models. The course structure aligns perfectly with my area of interest and are the advanced subjects that I have studied in my undergrad, so these all reasons made it an ideal choice.

Yes I applied to 6 universities and got the offers from 3 of them including RU.

I am working as a Program manager in a fintech company, name XYZ. Its a good place but my growth has halted and for that reason I am going for a masters degree from abroad.

"
335,"
To the people getting rejected: I know it may seem like that you are rejected for no reason and many of you have posted sharing your concerns that you are rejected and have expressed your frustration too. So let me explain you the major reason. Before I explain you the reason let me tell you that I have received two F visas and one J visa with no travel history before my first visa. Currently I am doing my PhD. So one of the major reason is Finances.
Let’s be honest when you 
show bank statements, are you really going to be using those finances? And VO knows that! They know that the 70 lacs you are showing many of you don’t intend to use that money and just showing it to get the visa. After you get the visa, you will start thinking how you will pay for your education. So if you don’t have a full-ride or a loan, or a TA or RA ship you won’t be able to pay for your education. Don’t be misled thinking that you will be able to make sufficient money with an on-campus job, the on-campus job is only sufficient enough to pay for some of your expenses such as food, bills and sometimes rent. You can’t pay tuition and health insurance with a part time job and working full-time or working off-campus during semesters is ILLEGAL! Majority of you are rejected primarily because of your finances because your finance story doesn’t make sense. VO knows the cost of living in US, and cost of tuition, they are mentioned on your I-20. So they are well aware that you won’t be able to furnish this amount and the bank statement that you showed is probably just to show so you can get that visa. 
Yes, not getting the visa is disappointing. But it will be more disappointing once you get to US and can’t pay for your expenses. So again if you don’t have a full-ride, A TA/RA offer or majority tuition scholarship, don’t think that you will be able to manage the finances. 
Hope this helps and clears some doubts. Don’t blame the embassy or the system because if you are eligible for visa, you will get one but if you know deep down that “I am just showing these statements to get visa, I won’t be using this money” than know that VO knows this and you won’t get the visa. 
Best of luck!

University of arizona 
Bacholars
Please everyone read it and let me know what can I improve in next interview and what were my mistakes because my classes will Start soon and I can't delay them, I already had a gap year.
Vo:show me your documents
Me: passed them
Vo: financial statement 
Me: passed them
Vo: this is just a bunch of papers
( I didn't knew what to answer about it, like I can not bring money here obviously it have to be on paper) whatever
Me: explained that this is my mother's account and it has money generated from her school/collage.
Vo: which school
Me: named the school
(It's a local school)
Vo: started typing the name of school on computer, maybe he was searching about the school.
Vo: which university 
Me: university of Arizona 
Vo: how did you got to know about it?
Me: searched about good ranking universities and so
Vo: what will you study 
Me: software engineering 
Now here I am a little confused, I can not remember what he asked for, maybe my future plan or maybe why I want to study software engineering.
Me: I proceeded to explain him that I what to convert my mother's school and collage in IT University, as all great university are in lahore  islamabad and karachi, for computer and faislabad is deprived of great universities, so students have to migrate from there to other cities which everyone can not afford. And many parents don't allow and students also have safety problem.
Vo: that's more than enough
(The reality is that, EVERYTHING I SAID HERE WAS A LIE, I DONT WANT TO PROCEED WITH THE UNIVERSITY, I WANT TO OPEN A SOFTWARE HOUSE IN PAKISTAN, but I thought that he might not be convinced with software house as it can be opened anywhere and not necessarily in pakistan, so lied about the university. I think this was kind of biggest mistake, as the person before me gave the same kind of Statement 
Like good country man, help my nation, help my brother, help My country, blah blah, something like this, so my statement also seems kind of fake created, that I want to help people of my city.)
Proceeding
Vo: any relatives there
Me: no
Vo: have you been there before
Me: no
Vo: siblings 
Me: one is AS and second one in 7th class
Vo: father
Me: banker in ...... bank 
Me added we have rental home from where get rent.
(This was not true but i had to justify the bank statement soo) 
Vo: how many
Me: 4
That's what I remember, 
Then he took some time, disappear to side or somewhere, then proceeded to give the yellow paper, 
The paper said that I could not establish ties with my country, and I am not proving that I will return.
Now things I am planning to change. 
1. Tell them the real aim, of building software house
2. Take my ntn, proof which shows that there is a school which is on my mother's name.
What else should I improve, please share your valuable views.
"
337,"
Hi I had my visa rejected a week ago based on failure to show ties to home country 214b. To avoid this situation in next interview can I show one of followings in next interview for strong case:
1. An employment letter from a company existing in my village ( my current employer is an MNC which won't provide such a letter)
2. Stating I have wife and children living with parents here ( showing marriage certificate and birth certificates)
3. Father owned lands in my village ( can 
show ownership documents)
4. Stating that my father is retired and he wants to invest his savings in my so I study well and come back to support family ( can show retirement letter etc)
If anyone has better idea please suggest.

In my first attempt, I was too much nervous and couldn't explain even a single sentence. But in 2nd attempt I was very confident. I was speaking loudly and with proper eye contact with visa officer.
Thanks to

I have been rejected once on 25th May 2021
Program Master in Engineering Management 
Indiana Institue of Technology.
I have 3.05 CGPA in bachelor.
I 
was first sponsoring by my uncle and he is a US citizen... 
I was rejected in interview.
I have taken admission in university in the same state where my uncle lives.
Now, for 2nd time, what can I do? 
Can I change university and go with the same sponsor or not? 
Actually, my father in Pakistan has no cash money in bank and all are invested in property.
So, I have no bank statement in Pakistan 
So, if I arrange 50,60Lacks from invester so I must pay 2.5 Lac to him 
So, I want to know that is there any chance of visa if I change my university and get admission in other state where my uncle is not living and go with same sponsor (my uncle) or not?
Your replies would highly appreciated

Looking for the genuine help! 
I've been rejected twice in the F1 Visa interview at Karachi Consulate (1st by Chinese VO, 2nd by 1st counter American with slightly bald personality).
I have 100% scholarship from the university for my masters. I've applied to only one school though. 
Should I apply for the third time with the same profile or leave it?
I'm just concerned that I don't want to change my university, but what should I say when the VO will ask ""What Circumstances Have You Changed This Time?"".

Visa 
status:- rejected
What are you going to study?
Me:- to pursue double major in economics and business administration for my undergraduate degree
Why this university.
Me:- there are mainly two reasons, first my majors are well organized and dedicated like business administration major also focus on data analysis which attracts me. Second, i talked to a student there who is representative of Pakistan, so always got positive response in term of campus activities, supportive administration and Pakistan community.
How many universities did you applied.
Me:- i applied to 10 universities and got accepted to 7 universities and named them
Did you applied Pakistan universities?
Me:- yes i applied to IBA, but i want to avail opportunity to study in USA
What's changed from your previous rejection?
Yes, in my last interview i mentioned wrong major in ds160 and after refusal my university ask me to fill ds160 according to i20 and apply again for visa. So here I'm with right one
What did you filled in last ds160.
 Me:- i only mentioned economics with mathematics by thinking that economics is a business major, and didn't mentioned that.
Then rejected on 214b

Undergrad GPA: 3.75
IELTS: 8.0
Questions VO asked me:
VO: Is it a masters program?
ME: Yes, masters.
VO: Why are you going to the US?
ME: To pursue my masters degree in Human Resource Management from Northeastern University in Boston.
VO: Did you apply to any other universities?
ME: Yes, I applied to two other universities. Boston University and University of Notre Dame, in Indiana. 
VO: Were you accepted to any of those?
ME: I was rejected by Notre Dame but accepted into Boston University.
VO: Have you ever travelled abroad?
ME: No, I haven't
VO: So you have a brother in the US?
ME: Yes, my brother lives in US. He is also a graduate of Northeastern University. And is currently working there in a company. 
VO: Why did you choose to pursue this program now?
ME: Well I graduated last year with my bachelors degree. Since then I've been working in a school as an English teacher. I was made HOD of the English department & I became interested in HR management. And since there weren't many good options for this degree in Pakistan, I thought why not go to the US.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME: My father is my sponsor.
VO: What does your sponsor do?
ME: He is a recently retired police officer from Punjab police. He currently owns a pharmacy business in Lahore.
VO: Ok, I'm approving your visa. 
I found the VO to be very professional. He would interrupt most my answers by saying ""Ok got it"" when he wanted me to stop talking and I would. I was honest and confident. That's the key. Also your choice of University really matters, in my opinion. 
3 guys were rejected before me. 1 girl who went before me was approved.  They were all re-applying. This was my first attempt. 
Good luck everyone!

VO was lady rejected F1 student before me.
Fingerprints done after 3 attempts
It was a very long interview.
*Note*There is possibilities that the sequence of questions might be incorrect.
My interview went very smoothly even beyond my expectations. and I was very confident.
VO: Why you specifically want to study in USA?
Me: Officer its quite different from other countries. you guys believe in giving practical exposure along with research opportunity and I really want to explore the multicultural environment of USA. apart from this usa degree will give me competitive advantage here back in Pakistan with tremendous job opportunities. 
So I will definitely experience a good learning environment. 
VO: oh so want to explore the culture as well with smile..
Me: yes Officer university life is not all about studies and I want to explore the cultural diversity of USA.
VO: thats great..
VO: you applied to any other colleges.
Me: yes Officer I applied to DePaul university, Hofstra university, UIC, southern new samphire university and Adelphi university. 
VO: So why you chose DePaul University?
Me: There were a few things that I had in mind for my university selection. The curriculum should have a dedicated career track in business analytics with real time problem solving subjects like capstone and management internship and for these courses recently depaul university has launched beta lab. It’s a virtual platform for students to solve business problem by implementing real world data using different softwares such as SAP, Oracle Tableau and power BI. Also I’m particularly interested business intelligence and big data analysis and Don Pitchell who director of business analytics program is one the top researchers in the area. So If I would get a chance to work under him as a research assistant it would be greater opportunity for me. 
VO: okay… 
Me: yes Ma’m I have also done extensive research prior to applying at DePaul University. 
VO: ohh so you have contacted any students.
Me: yes Officer I have contact with current student and I found out that students can actually interact directly with professor rather than their TA, I mean what else do I need student right.
VO: How this will relate with you future goals? 
Me:I want to pursue career as a business analyst, which is the fastest growing field literally in every sector of Pakistan. as we’re still developing country and there is a huge market gap in Building tech industry. I will definitely get a good return out of the investment. 
But Officer… 
VO: yeah continue..
Me: My ultimate vision  is to get 3 to 4 years of experience and I will start up my own business consultancy firm. as you know business has been suffered alot in the pandemic and due to lack of disastrous management and modern analytical tools.
VO: is there any family member or other relative in USA. 
Me: No Officer there is no one in USA from my family.
VO: I can see you have been rejected before. 
Me: yes Officer I was nervous because it was my first visa interview and I couldn’t answer to questions that were asked to me and visa officer was not satisfied with my answers and this time I have changed the approach to explain my self.
 VO: have you considered any other country like Canada, UK and Pakistan. 
Me: No Ma’m haven’t considered Pakistan because there a few university that are currently offering Business analytics program and I would hardly get research opportunity and practical exposure. So I will definitely experience a good learning environment. 
VO: what about fundings?
Me: My father is sponsoring me he has savings of *** and *** immovable assists for my studies and part from this I have got 5000 dollar scholarship.
VO: So what does your sponsor do. 
Me: He is a business man and own a well established business.(interpreted) 
VO: what business??
Me: it’s actually Fertilizers distribution business (interpreted) 
VO: its the same business that you’re currently working. 
Me: yes Officer as a Business development Manager. Continue… and he is one few authored dealers of Engro incorporation which is the Pakistan’s number 1 fertilizer production company. And he has been doing this business since 11 years and he has over a dozen of employees and his annual income is ***. 
VO: I know you’re a genuine student and You really want to study in USA but unfortunately you’re not qualified for this time.
Me: Ma’m is there any specific reason. 
VO: No there is not any specific reason but But I’m giving you the slip and reason is mentioned in slip.

Hello Aslawalakum To all members.
My interview was on 22th December .Karachi Conusulate Counter number 6.
Visa Rejected.
Me: Good Morning Sir.
Vo:Rude korean guy no reply.
Vo: 
Pass me your i20 and passport.
Me: Yes sure sir with very smile.
Vo:Why Us?
Me: US is famous for their quality of education and technology. Bachelor's degree from the USA is highly recognized back here in Pakistan. Thats why, i want to pursue my bachelors in computer science from the USA and come back to Pakistan and start a training and IT consultancy firm.
Vo: Nice , Why this university?
Me: It is a highly ranked university in the USA. They have small size classes and highly talented faculty. They focus on student learning and growing and also provide internships so you can get real world experience during your degree. Also another reason would be that based on my academic profile this university has offered me 70% scholarship. I believe I can learn alot from St Thomas university and bring it to my country and share that culture and knowledge.
Vo: Is there any relative in Minnesota?
Me: No sir .
Vo: Here is your passport good luck for next time.
Please Tell me what should i do now?
Actually my ds 160 payment was done by my brothers friend and also sevis fees was paid from an American card ,he is living in st thomas university.
What should i do now?
This korean is very rude at counter number 6.
Can anybody help me in this situation as i am under 18. My academics results are all A*.

Suggestion Needed! 
I got rejected for my F1 Visa in the first attempt. VO asked me about my finances and I told her that I'm self-sponsoring myself and that I got the money from my father. She also asked about my employment where I told her that I'm currently unemployed. Before all of you guys start lecturing me how terrible my answers were, I already know that. So, kindly give me suggestions what should I change for my 2nd interview. 
1. Should I show my father as my sponsor 
the next time? If yes, than should I show his bank statement or mine. I have the money in my own account currently. The problem with this case is that my father is a businessman but as most of the businesses in Pakistan, the documentation is not proper and I can't prove the source of these funds. 
2. My uncle has a multinational company which is strongly related to my field. I could show him as the sponsor and show strong financial documentation.  
Kindly tell me which scenario would make my case strong.

I'm an international student in the US. I got married in January. My husband applied for student visa but his visa got rejected (that was a month before we got married). A lawyer suggested that I should sponsor him on F2 visa. 
Can someone please guide me about what kind of questions they ask during the F2 visa? I've studied about the process but I'd like to know about the personal experience of someone here regarding F2 visa
Please guide me
Thank you

Please can someone guide me what should be the possible way to solve this matter?
