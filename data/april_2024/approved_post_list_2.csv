Alhamdulillah 
Date : 19sep 
Islamabad
Status : Approved 
University: eastern Michigan University 
Course: bachelor’s in mechanical engineering 
Refusal from Australia 
Rejection from uk universities in interview 
Then I connected with Allah and got the result 
I was quite nervous because the officer rejected 3 visas in front of me but also he approved 1 student visa so in the start i was narvous

alhamdulillah By the grace of Allah visa approved 
F1-Visa approved 
6th December 
( 
Karachi embassy )
Appointment time 10:00 am 
Visa officer was a lady around 40 or above counter number 5 
Interview experience:

Embassy: Islamabad
Date: 12 May
Visa Status: Approved
I was a bit nervous and none of my answers went 100% smooth.
Here's how interview went.
VO: Hello(in very friendly tone)
Me: Hi
VO: (After taking my docs and entering them on PC) Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going to attend Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Cincinnati.
VO: (After a pause) Why did you choose this University?
Me: (I stuttered during this answer a bit) I am going because this university is aligned with my research interest.
VO: Why did you choose University of Cincinnati specifically?
Me: Because the lab facilities and faculty is suited to my research in additive manufacturing. It's the same research that I did in my bachelor's. (stuttered here too)
VO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father. (I stopped after saying this for around 20 secs and then started speaking again) He is manager at X and makes Y money through job Z money through rentals and some money thru real estate trading which I don't know how much is.
VO: Cograts. Enjoy your stay at united states.
Me: Thanks.
Thoughts? 
The visa doesn't mostly depend on the interview. The VO wasn't even listening to me with attention. It depends on your uni, course and any funding you have(I had $20k scholarship). My interview wasn't the best. Actually, I would say it was average or below average.
Almost all visas(5/5) got approved before me. Only 2 were refused, who went after me. Those 2 had genuine reasons to refuse. If I were VO, I would even refuse them(not cuz of hate lol but their case didn't seem strong on paper)
Suggestions?
1. Don't go for consultants. They apply for you at few unis which VOs are aware of. VOs don't even consider you in that case. They straight away reject you.
2. Take IELTS. Take GRE. Secure full/partial scholarship(you can easily get it). Then go for visa. You will get it InshAllah.

Sorry for the very long post
Visa Approved Alhamdulillah 
Date: November 15th
Time: 10:30 Am
Karachi Consulate
Counter 7: Middle Aged White Lady
Passport Delivered: November 18th
Arrived in the US: December 23rd
University: Roosevelt University Chicago
I hope this interview experience will give hope to many of you aspiring to apply and study in the US. My profile was far from ordinary and there were so many “Red Flags” that I had very little hope of getting my visa approved. This group has been extremely helpful and supportive in the entire process.
Major Red Flags in my profile:
1. Immigration petition filed for my entire family through my mother back in 2010. (I was not the main applicant so I chose “NO” in the DS-160 question for immigration petition).
2. Sponsored by my Uncle.
3. Low Ranked University no one has heard about before. (I went with it because I had a low CGPA).
4. No scholarship at all.
5. No recent travel history.
6. Lots of family in the US.
Interview:
VO: Hi, Passport and I-20 please.
Me: Hi, there you go.
VO: Why are you going to the US?
Me: For a Master’s Degree in Computer science.
VO: Why go for a masters if you already have a bachelor’s degree?
Me: Bachelor’s is the first step for me, since I want to do research in my field in the future, Master’s is needed before I go for a PhD.
VO: Oh so you want to do a PhD?
Me: Yes, after I complete this master’s degree.
VO: PhD in what?
Me: AI and Machine Learning.
VO: Okay, what specifically in AI and Machine Learning?
Me: Augmented Driving Systems.
VO: Oh that’s nice (with an impressed look). So why did you choose this University? And how did you find it?
Me: Well honestly, I applied to about 9 universities and only 3 accepted me — among those 3, this one was the best choice in terms of ranking and other factors. (Then I named all 9 universities).
VO: Did anyone help you find this university?
Me: Uhmm, just the internet and some friends.
VO: Okay, and who is your sponsor?
Me: My uncle will be my sponsor.
VO: What does he do?
Me: He is a Director of XYZ at XYZ (Semi Gov Institution).
VO: Nice, what about your parents? What do they do?
Told
VO: Okay and does your uncle have any children?
Me: He doesn’t have any children of his own but he does have an adopted son who is young, about 5 years old right now.
VO: Okay and do you have any siblings?
Me: Yes, I have a sister. She is becoming a Chartered Accountant and is doing her Articles now. She has about 2 years left to complete that.
VO: Okay okay, and do you have any family in the US?
Me: Yes, my uncles.
VO: Oh, your other uncles?
Me: Yes.
VO: (While looking at my I-20), do they live in….
Me: I interrupted her and said no, they live in NY my university is in Chicago.
VO: Okay… everything seems to be good. I am approving your Visa and we will keep your passport, remember you cannot enter the US before December 16th.
Me: Yes, I know. Thank you officer have a nice day. Good bye.
My only advice is to Keep your Faith in Allah, ask for your wishes in Dua and be confident. If Allah wants something for you it will happen.
If any of you need any information please feel free to send me a DM and I will do my best to help you.

***APPROVED***
LOCATION KARACHI
TIME SLOT 8.30
BUSINESS ANALYTICS (MS)
INTERVIEWER: INFAMOUS ASIAN
NO GRE
NO IELTS
GPA 2.86
Date: 8th June.
DISCLAIMER: My interview was very different from others so please don't take it as a guide as I don't want to mislead anyone.
After preparing myself for straight 20 days I went for an Interview, I was prepared for every kind of question, but there was something else written in my fate.
VO DID NOT ASK ANY COMMON QUESTIONS LIKE:
Why US? 
Why this university?
Rather he started like this
1) what are your daily responsibilities in your current job?
2) what does your father do? (Convinced with my one word ANSWER)
3) what are your plans after graduation? (Told him the names of 3 it companies name where I'm aiming to work at)
4) do you have any relatives? I said yes because I didn't want to lie
5) will you leave the current job? I said yes (btw I just joined that job 20 days ago)
Conclusion: All that time he was behaving as if the decision is already decided because he seemed too uninterested to hear my answers. It was like as if he was just completing a formality nothing else.
In a nutshell, for me US F1 VISA IS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON LUCK BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A HEC FUNDED PHD LEVEL GUY GETTING REJECTED WHOSE PROFILE WAS 4X STRONGER THAN MINE.
BUT GO WELL PREPARED AND BE CONFIDENT. I ALSO GREETED HIM IN A VERY LOUD VOICE. Also don't forget to pray and take your mother's prayers as they can do wonders.
GOODLUCK!
Thankyou 
Rana Ibrar
 for helping me throughout this journey.

Interview Status: Approved
Date: Sept 2013
I see a similar post where a member shared his/her past approval process so I wanted to share mine as well to give our members some confident
My 
interview took only 2 to 3 minutes and I still remember our conversation
I passed my i20 to interviewer and he asked following questions.
IO: Which University?
Me: Webster University, st louis MO
IO: Which program
Me: MS Finance
IO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father and handed him his business card.
He did look his card for few minutes. Not to mention i did bring all bank statements, educational documents with me but he didn't see anything
After few moments, IO said I am approving your visa Congratulations. No further questions asked why this program etc!
I remember when I was leaving embassy with smile, the security guard said you are the 1st person till now who is going out with smile 
Now after almost 10 years, i am US citizen already.
No, i did not over stayed my visa, nor filed for asylum or looked for short cuts here. I did finish my masters, opt, employer sponsorship and then citizenship. If you think getting married with US citizen will give you a chance here, so be prepared there is a chance if you are honest but getting married here to obtain citizenship only will not only put your immigration application as fraudulent but also you may be banned from getting US citizenship. It was easy before to get immigration through this way but not anymore.
There is NO short cut in US immigration. If you are already here, focus on the purpose why you are here. Concentrate on your studies and take it from there. Trust me, even after studies if you dont get any chance of immigration here, with your US educational degree, you can achieve so much anywhere. All the best!
Those who are applying for visa, good luck to you all. If you don't get it please don't get disheartened. Its all about luck and destiny. As everyone wants to live American life, its not easy at all

Somewhere deep down I wanted to change that and for this exact reason I plan to do my research in “Diversity and inclusion in Engineering education”.  (I was not interrupted at all by VO so I kept on talking). Although PhD in this field is being offered by other US universities as well but I chose this university cuz I had read a few research papers of Prof xyz so I dropped  her an email expressing my interest to work with her to which she replied then we had a zoom a session and she agreed to supervise me provided I can get myself admitted by meeting the requirements of graduate school. I then applied at uni portal and not only did I get admitted but I was also offered a full scholarship.
That was a long answer but I just did not wanna stop until I was interrupted so I kept going.
VO:  So you have assistantship?
Me: Yes I do have it.
VO: So what exactly would you do in your research?
Me: There would basically be 3 major research questions and then went on to state all 3 of them.
VO: Tell me how as a male you came to realize the underrepresentation of women in engineering?
Till now, VO would ask me a question and then would start typing on the computer and would occasionally make an eye contact. But after asking this question, she took both her hands off keyboard and placed on the table as if she was very eager to listen to my answer.
Me:  When I was doing my bachelors, there were only 2 girls in a class of 50 people. During the fours years of my professional career, there was only a handful of representation of female members of the society and even those who were there, they would put in a resign after sometime. So I always had it in back of my hand that if we are not taking measures to make our educational institutes diverse and inclusive then we would have to bear severe economical repercussions.
VO: Do you have bachelor's in STEM?
Me: Yes, I did my bachelor's in electronics engineering.
VO: Which school would you be joining in UB?
Me: School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
VO kept typing for few seconds and then out came the golden words. Your visa is approved and she handed me over the blue slip.
Well in my view giving confident answers by maintaining  eye contact with the VO does make a massive difference. VO did not ask for anything from me not even my own CV. The other thing is being proactive in the interview can pass you off as someone who knows what he is doing.

Visa Approved in the third attempt!
Sharing this experience as a hope for many of you guys who will be appearing in their third attempt. I was refused twice in May and June from Islamabad Consulate. I applied again with the same profile after deferring my admission in the Karachi Consulate. 
I was refused first time around for showing myself self sponsoring my education even though I wasn't doing any job and my father had given me the funds back then too. It was a blunder from 
my side in the first attempt. 
2nd time around, the interview lasted only a minute, before visa officer refused me without asking any major questions. It was quite tough to gather the confidence for applying again after such an interview. 
Interview on 26th October.
University of Houston.
Master's in Industrial Engineering.
Karachi Consulate. 
Visa officer was an American Male in his 40's. 
When I reached the counter, we greeted each other and after that there was a pause of around 2-3 minutes without Vo asking me anything as he was going through my profile. 
Vo: Tell me about your parents.
My mother is a housewife. My father is an industrialist, we have have a business of manufacturing of adhesives and lubricants which my grandfather started 50 years back and after him his sons are managing it now and also the reason why I want to do industrial engineering, as I have to comeback and manage it afterwards.
Vo: In how many uni's did you apply?
I applied to a total of 5 uni's, out of which I got accepted into 4 of them. I applied to Clemson University where I got rejected from, and I got acceptances from UIC, USF, FSU and UOH where I'm going. Among them I choose University of Houston because Houston is a big industrial city and UOH has strongly industrial affiliated faculty. There are couple of professors at UOH, who take their students for industrial visits every week as part of their curriculum which enhance their practical knowledge which I'm looking for. 
I was quite animated at this moment and was making some hand gestures which annoyed the Vo. He asked me to stop doing that and answer him as I was talking to a friend. 
Vo: So you have one brother who is handling your family business? (I don't know where he got this from)
I told him that I have two elders brothers and they are also handling the business and well.
Vo: Have your brothers also studied from aboard?
No. They have got their education in Pakistan. 
Vo: Why do they want to send you abroad?
Told the visa officer how many brothers always wanted me to get the exposure and how they have always encouraged me to pursue education from abroad. I did an Aiesec internship in 2019, mentioned that too.
After this the Vo stopped asking questions and tried to make a decision but he was undecided at this time. I asked him I could help him with anything else but he said that he is not sure either way right now. I asked him should I tell him about why choose Industrial Engineering in the first place. He said no and that I would have read the website and would just pour it all out on him. 
I said no, just let me explain why I wanted to do Industrial Engineering.
Told him about Industrial Engineering and how USA is the pioneer of this field and that only a couple of uni's in germany and canada are offering this course with the same curriculum. Also mentioned that I have acceptances from Canada and Australia as well but I choose USA because of their quality etc.
Vo: Did your Visa also got rejected from Canada and Australia?
No. I didn't apply for Visa there, as I wanted to study Industrial Eng and my courses were different there.
Vo was still undecided trying to make a decision.
Vo: How big is your industry.
Told him about the number of people working there.
Vo: Okay, tell me about your time at Turkey.
Told him about Aiesec and how this internship gave me exposure and boosted my confidence etc. 
Eventually, the Vo handed me the blue slip. 
Vo: Enjoy your time in the USA.

vo: purpose of traveling to USA?
me: well officer I am going to usa for my professional pilot training from pelican flight training llc which is in miami Florida (I noticed he was still listening to me so I continued speaking)the reason I selected us because American pilot license is a very demanding pilot license in the aviation industry and as I plan to start my Career here in pakistan as an airline pilot after completing my training from usa so getting my pilot license from will really help me to increase job job opportunities for me here in pakistan as a pilot because all the airlines of pakistan accepts the American pilot license and prefer the American trained pilots that's why I'm emphasizing on going to us for my flight training program. although I also searched about flight training programs in uk and gulf countries as well but in uk programs are 4 years long and cost is 2 times than usa where as in gulf programs r 5 years long and r 3 times expensive than usa and I am in also in contact with few pilots In pakistan did their from us they also recommend me to go to usa for flight training as it will increase job opportunities for me here in pakistan.
vo:what is an aileron?
me:well sir aileron is an primary flight control system of the aircraft attached to the wings of the aircrafts and r connected to the yokes or side sticks of the aircraft and r used to turn the aircraft in the air the ailerons r also connected to the turn indicator of the plane which is an important instrument in the cockpit helps the pilots to see the turn angle of the aircraft.
vo:(hands over the blue slip) enjoy ur stay in usa
me:thank u sir when can I have my passport?
vo: 5 din baad
 I left then counter and thanked ALLAH for the accepting my prayers 
I also had a session with argo visa to prepare for my next attempt the session really helped me they gave me advice not to stop speaking till vo is listening and the advices they gave me to fulfill ds160 specially the section in which we have to mention the reason of our refusal o followed their advices.
and ALSO make dua from ALLAH to give u what u want. make dua between Alan and iqamah as PROPHET MUHAMMAD(P.B.U.H) said supplications made between Azan and iqamah r never rejected (tirmidhi 3594)
make dua in tahajjud as well because if u really want some thing something pray tahajjud for it 
and whenever u make dua forst recite dua of HAZRAT YUNUS A.S THAT he recited in belly of whale then make dua ALLAH WILL accept ur dua its also an hadith of PROPHET MUHAMMAD(P.B.U.H) WHOEVER recites the dua of YUNUS A.S and makes dua ALLAH WILL ACCEPT HIS DUA

Date: 24th June 2023
Interview time: 9:15am
Actual interview: 11:45am 
Karachi Consulate 
Although there were few minor mishaps that happened too that day but i tried to remain calm and relaxed throughout and managed to convince the VO to approve my visa Alhamdulilah. At first i wasn’t given any token number and when i realized that i have no token number, i went back and got token number of much later time 
 Next, i was instructed to bring another passport size photo from the nearest studio as early as possible as my current picture wasn’t acceptable since i was wearing a hijab and some sides were not visible (according to them). Anyways, i went to the nearest studio (Dosani’s) and came back after an hour. And waited half an hour more to have my interview. 
I greeted him, he ignored and had a straight bezaar face. VO was a male. He asked me to pass my documents. I did. 
VO: So why are you going to US
Me: To pursue dual Masters in public informatics and urban planning from Rutgers University, New Jersey.
VO: Hold on, whats public informatics? Is it related to public health? 
Me: No its not related to public health, its related to data analytics. I tried explaining him the relevancy of this field with my field and how it aligns with my bachelors degree. He was listening me carefully and even typed it on his computer and i think read it online too on Rutgers website. I even mentioned few data related courses like GIS, Envi, python and he was like now whats GIS? So I explained him in detail about that too. 
VO: Okay so i see you have also gotten a 60% scholarship. How are you managing remaining funds? 
Me: My family is going to sponsor my education; that includes my father and two brothers. 
VO raised his eyebrows and looked at me.
I gave him my father’s background and of my brothers background. He asked me to pass their financial documents. He carefully saw each of those documents and verified the amount that i was stating while telling him about my father and brothers earnings and savings. I also told him about couple of investment lands that we own and their worth in dollars. 
Vo: Whats the status of your brothers in US?
Me: One of them is on H1B and another one has just started his professional hybrid masters program. 
Vo: Okay and what are your future plans? 
Me: Told
By that time he already took out a paper which i didn’t see which color that was. But he seemed satisfied and was smiling. 
Me: Last but not the least, one interesting fact is that when i first visited USA back in 2020, I got the chance to explore the campus of Rutgers New Brunswick, so this was also one of the reasons of selecting Rutgers apart from scholarship and its outstanding reputation. I am familiar with the place and have explored the campus for days. 
Vo: Thats wonderful. Congratulations i am approving your Visa. Im keeping your passport. Thankyou. Bye bye 
Me: Thankyou so much. Have a nice day. 
My advice: Be confident and well prepared. And dont be hideous at all. They already know everything about you and I could’ve said something else on the question of my brothers status but i chose to be honest and straightforward. 
Best of luck to everyone. Prayers for all. 
Allahumma Barik

Got my visa approved today. ALHUMDULILLAH. Here is my experience.
Degree and College: MS Mechanical Engineering from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.
Semester: Spring '24
Consulate: Karachi
Date: 21-08-23
VO 
was a middle-aged white man.
VO: Hi!
Me: Hello! good morning.
VO: Pass me these documents (I had my passport, I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation in my hand)
Me: Sure. There you go.
VO: (After looking at my documents) How old are you?
Me: I'm 23 years old.
VO: (After some time) so you are going to do your masters? 
Me: Yes sir!
VO: How did you get to know about this university?
Me: I came to know about SIUE from my FYP advisor. He has done researches and have publications in clean energy technologies. He has high regards for the work done by Dr. XYZ, he is a professor in the mechanical department of SIUE. Further upon my research I got to know that it is a notable institute in the Midwestern region. I also found the Uni to be affordable and upon completion of my admission process, I also recieved a scholarship of $8,000, which helped me finalising my decision to choose SIUE.
(VO hardly maintained any eye contact all this time)
VO: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Me: I have one younger brother.
VO: What do your parents do?
Me: My mother is a teacher at XYZ school and my father is a government employee in the ministry of XYZ as an Assistant Officer.
(He got a little confused at assistant officer, I had to tell him again and also mentioned my father's grade to him)
For a minute or so he kept typing something on his computer. And after a minute gave me my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation back.
At this point I was thinking that he didn't give me my passport back to me but then I saw him taking out a blue slip and eventually kept my mouth shut 
VO: There you go. (Not even a congratulations 
)
Me: Thank you. When can I have my passport back?
VO: You will receive an email in a week or so.
Me: Alright. Have a nice day. 
He only asked me 4 questions out of which I guess only 2 were relevant to my interview. He didn't ask for any single document other than my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation. I stayed confident, and maintained my tone but all of that wasn't even looked at 
. He already refused 2 F-1 candidates right infront of me and I was really scared but Alhumdulillah everything went far better than I expected. 
My question now is, how long will it take to get my passport back and when does the visa status on the portal gets updated??
Any questions are welcomed.

Prepare the answers to common questions from VO and analyze them until you get confidence that they are according to your case because only you know the best about yourself. Tell him like a story and show your accomplishments. No doubt, university and sponsorship matter but the most important thing that matters is how you are presenting your case if it makes sense then all OK. Your whole profile matter.
One last important thing which we often ignore, please be dressed as it depicts how serious you are about your study or the concerned post. They judge you from the very moment when you get up from the chair and move towards the window.
Best of luck all.
Thanks!

Interview was at 25th May Karachi Consulate.
Profile: BS from LUMS, going for MS Finance at University of Houston. Had Received out-of-station tuition waiver and additional scholarship as well. Have been working at Multinational bank for almost two years now.
VO: 
Pass me your passport and F1.
VO:  Why university of Houston?
ME: Firstly, the courses which they are offering, related to derivates trading and hedging and this is where my professional experience lies, as I have been working in the banking industry for over 2 years now, and I feel this degree would help me fill in the gaps in my skill set.
Also, one of my university professors had recommended this course and degree, as he had also completed his master’s from there.
Also, I have been following Professor XYZ, throughout my undergraduate phase, and read his publications on hedging techniques, so I thought it would be quite an experience to take live lectures from him.
VO: interesting!
VO: What is your job ?
ME: Told him about the general job description, routine tasks etc.
VO: Plans after graduation.
ME: Obviously, the plan is to complete my master’s with good GPA. And then to focus on my banking career, as employers in the Pakistani banking sectors tend to value those profiles and individuals who have done their education specifically from US Colleges. In fact, my current supervisor had done his Master’s from abroad, and at a very young age he is doing quite well. I have a similar objective, I believe this degree would help me to excel in the Pakistan banking sector, also that I have made good repo with my supervisor, he would be willing to hire me at a senior position, once I complete my master’s.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME:  it is my father.
VO: What is his profession?
ME: He is a banker as well, and currently working in one of the banks in UAE.
VO: Pass me the statement.
I handed over the statement to him.
VO: Your credentials are good, I am approving your visa. You will get your passport in a week.
For all the aspirants out here, the only thing matters is your level of confidence and communication skills. Regardless of the circumstances, and whatever is the outcome, just give your 100% and maintain eye-contact.

Karachi Consulate 
Masters in Engineering Management
Interview date: 16 June 2023
Time: 8:00 AM
VO  was a lady in her early 30’s
Me: Hey! Good Morning Mam
VO: Good Morning, How are you?
Me: I am Fine, what about you?
VO: I am fine too. Thanks for asking. Pass me your documents.
Me: Sure.
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going to pursue my Masters degree in Engineering management from XYZ University.
VO: Which degree have you recently completed?
Me: I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from XYZ University in karachi.
VO: When did you graduated?
Me: I graduated in October 2022.
*She was constantly typing on computer, there was 5-6 seconds gap after this question, so I started telling her that when I was in USA  in 2021, so I visited this university physically and met the ABC professor and ABC Professor, they both cooperate with me so much, and Dr. ABC gave me whole university tour, and also show me the research facility of Engineering management including all labs.*
VO: You were on your pleasure trip so why did you go to this city? As it is not a tourist city. Did you just go to specially visit this university?
Me: No no, I was on tour of Las vegas, los angeles and Orlando but in last I visited this city because my cousin live just 30 minutes away from this city, and he was giving me tour of beaches and several museums, during that I saw this university and planned to visit it on other day. My cousin is also a F1 student, studying in XYZ University.
VO: Oh Ok! So you were visiting your cousin in that city.
Me: Yes Mam.
VO: In how many universities did you applied?
Me: I just applied in this university, because I have physically visited this university so I was well aware of this university and city. As my CGPA is …….., so you know there are few better universities where we could apply.
VO: *nodded her head* Yes, you are right.
Me: As there is no consultant involved in my case, all I have done by my own after doing proper research between few universities. Rather than wasting my money and time by applying to several universities, I just focused on few universities and finalized this one. I also got a scholarship of ……… amount.
VO: You have done a good job! So what’s your plan to do ahead, I mean in which sector do you want to do certifications or job?
Me: I want to go towards the sustainable energy sector, as my FYP was also regarding that so I have much information on sustainable energy. 
*I explain here my FYP in few lines*
VO: Interesting. So tell me about your masters degree that is there just generally engineering management or you have to take any selective sub-field in that?
Me: In this university, there are several sub-field under engineering management, such as robotics and automation, supply chain management, civil engineering focus, Industrial Engineering focus, Mechanical engineering focus and chemical engineering focus.
VO: So, what you are going to pick?
Me: I will choose mechanical engineering focus, as my bachelors is in same field so I have a vast knowledge of it.
VO: Right! Why did you want to do masters degree?
Me: If I would be just having bachelors degree so it would be having not that much worth. If I want to get promoted to higher level so I must have a masters degree too. Well, I selected this program rather than selecting same program as my bachelors, the main reason is that if you want to go to management level post like to the highest post like CEO, so you must have management degree. What mostly engineers do is that they pursue simple MBA for this reason, and I think that if I would be doing MBA which is a business degree, after my BE Mechanical, so it would be like that I am throwing my technical field degree in dust bin. Therefore, I choose this program which is combination of management and engineering fields.
VO: Ok, right! What are you doing right now like are you studying any course or doing any job or something else?
Me: I am currently working in XYZ company as a mechanical engineer, you may see in my application that I have written NO in job section because when I booked my appointment so till then I was unemployed, but after 2 days of it I got a call from my CEO for vacant position of mechanical engineer. This is the same company where I had done my 2 months internship in month of December and January, as I was having a good working relation with my CEO so I asked him during my last days of internship that if there would be any vacancy of engineer post so he must let me know. I’ll be going on study leave, and it has been granted to me along with surety that when I will be back so I will be promoted to XYZ post due to my masters in engineering management. Do you want to see those letters?
VO: No, I don’t want to see anything, just you tell me verbally, its ok.
*she was constantly typing, so to gain her attention I start talking about my Exchange program trip to USA in 2016, where we were guest of University of Toledo, after hearing this she start talking to me again*
VO: So how long was your trip?
Me: It was just for 15 to 16 days, and I also got just 20 days visa for it. You may see it in my passport.
VO: Yeah, most of the time for exchange program, only limited time visa is granted. So, when you were in that city where you are going to do masters, what did you like there and what did you didn’t like?
Me: I love it, the calmness, its nature and the people are so much caring and lovely. There is not a single thing which I could say that I didn’t like. 
VO: Not a single thing! There must be anything that you may have thought that this shouldn’t be like this?
Me: No mam, seriously, there is not a single thing like that. That whole city is amazing.
VO: Good. Ok! (She start smiling ) So I am approving you visa. Good luck for your trip to USA. Hope you will like it. Well, we are also conducting pre-departure orientation ( she gave me blue slip along with the orientation pamphlet), I would suggest you to register yourself and must attend this, it would be helpful.

Date: 14th October 
Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.
VO: ahan.. what do you do there?
Me: Mentioned about my duties 
VO: hmm okay (asked for my old passport) 
VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

I was very nervous when I arrived at the embassy, but when I went inside and saw the relaxed environment, I started feeling more at ease. The atmosphere was very comfortable, and seeing that made my confidence boost. I spoke with the Visa Officer in a friendly manner, as if I was having a conversation with a friend. I had prepared long answers, but during the interview, I only spoke when necessary and avoided giving unnecessary details.
I want to tell all of you that feeling nervous is valid. It's okay to be nervous, and that's completely normal. Just don't stress out. I can't express how nervous and stressed I was, but once I was there, the environment made it easy, and I was able to manage my nervousness. One more important thing: hold on tightly to your faith in ALLAH. Our success is not because of our efforts alone, it's by the will of Allah. Get close to Him and put your trust in Him. Pray Tahajjud and Nawafil, and have faith in every aspect of your journey. They really helped me stay relaxed.
Additionally, this group also played a significant role in helping me. If your DS-160 form is filled out correctly, you have all the required tests and documents, then you're on the right track to get your visa.

F-1 Visa Interview Experience
Status: Approved
Date: 1st April, 2024
Time: 7:30
Location: Islamabad 
Profile: Ohio university with a 18k scholarship (only 6k of tuition left) I already have a Canadian and US visit visa.
VO: a white man with a thick beard on the first counter (14 I think?)
(for privacy reasons, I will be redacting some people and institutes)
VO: Good morning. Can you give me your passport and I-20?
me: Good morning (gave him the documents)
VO: Why are you choosing Ohio University?
me: While OU is a well-ranked university, three factors influenced my decision to choose OU. The first factor is the Entrepreneurship honors program which I have been accepted to, which I believe, in addition to my degree, will help me develop and hone skills to be a successful individual. Secondly, As you can see from my I-20, I have been awarded a generous scholarship of $18,000, which helps me immensely financially. The third factor is Familial Support; My eldest brother is doing his [REDACTED] in [REDACTED NEIGHBOURING STATE] with a non-immigrant J-1 visa. Although I will be staying on campus to get the most out of campus life, having that familial support will help me transition better into the US culture.
VO: Do you have another sibling in [REDACTED]?
me: Yes, my second eldest brother.
VO: (typed for a few seconds) Did you get any other funding? (looking at my I-20)
me: Yes actually, I got an additional 3000$ from the University's honors program but they were not able to update my I-20 as the award was awarded after the I-20 was issued (so that brought my total scholarship to 18K a year)
VO: How are you gonna pay for the rest?
me: well my second eldest brother, who is a [REDACTED JOB TITLE] at [REDACTED COMPANY NAME] in [REDACTED NON-US COUNTRY] has offered to sponsor my studies.
VO: Do you have a valid B1/B2 Visa?
Me: Yes, I do.
 VO: which school did you go here? (I though he said why don't I go to a school here)
me: (started answering)
VO: Yes but that was not what I asked, I asked which school did you go to here?
Me: oh sorry, I thought you asked something else. (told him my school name)
VO: any previous schools?
me: yes ( told him the name)
VO: thank you. Please collect your passport in a week.
Thoughts: So I would say don't hide anything from them first of all. I have a brother in the States and told them about it blatantly because they already know it, so, there is no use hiding if you have someone in the US. Be confident about it. Second, If you have any additional info about your I-20 or any changes in it please inform them, they understand that there can be problems like I had, with international students. If you mishear anything, that's also fine. Don't panic, stay clam and inshallah you will get it.

me: Yes actually, I got an additional 3000$ from the University's honors program but they were not able to update my I-20 as the award was awarded after the I-20 was issued (so that brought my total scholarship to 18K a year)
VO: How are you gonna pay for the rest?
me: well my second eldest brother, who is a [REDACTED JOB TITLE] at [REDACTED COMPANY NAME] in [REDACTED NON-US COUNTRY] has offered to sponsor my studies.
VO: Do you have a valid B1/B2 Visa?
Me: Yes, I do.
 VO: which school did you go here? (I though he said why don't I go to a school here)
me: (started answering)
VO: Yes but that was not what I asked, I asked which school did you go to here?
Me: oh sorry, I thought you asked something else. (told him my school name)
VO: any previous schools?
me: yes ( told him the name)
VO: thank you. Please collect your passport in a week.
Thoughts: So I would say don't hide anything from them first of all. I have a brother in the States and told them about it blatantly because they already know it, so, there is no use hiding if you have someone in the US. Be confident about it. Second, If you have any additional info about your I-20 or any changes in it please inform them, they understand that there can be problems like I had, with international students. If you mishear anything, that's also fine. Don't panic, stay clam and inshallah you will get it.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT HISTORY:
I had my both attempts from Karachi counsellete and with the same Webster University. First Interview was a detailed one. VO asked me all about the application. She might got confused with my financials because I didn't explained all about my sponser's finacial.
Second attempt was pathetic. VO didn't ask much. He was constantly staring at the screen and was reading previous notes. At that moment I was loosing my confidence and becoming anxious.After wasting 3-4 minutes he just asked 3 or 4 questions about my profile that I answered. Again i got refused under section 214(b). It was like that he already made his decision earlier.

Date: November 2011
Visa Counselor (VC): Good morning
Me: Good morning, How are you?
VC: 
Good. So why are you going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Oral Biology from Uni of Louisville, Kentucky. It’s a research based program. 
VC: How many programs did you apply?
Me: I applied to 5 programs all over the world and got accepted in all of them. 2 in Germany, 1 in UK, 1 in Canada and 1 in US. 
VC: why US?
Me: Because I emailed the professor and he liked my past research projects. His area of research aligns with my future research endeavors. That’s why I would like to pursue this program. 
VC: Who is sponsoring your studies?
Me: I saved some money working for almost 2 years and my dad has some savings. (Tuition and living cost for 2 years was $45,000. I had managed to bring a six month bank statement of $45,550 
My contributions in that was $550 only 
. Rest of the money was loan from family and friends. Everybody chipped in there life savings). She didn’t see that bank statement document so that was a waste of effort. 
VC: Did you give any standardized tests to get admission in this program?
Me: Yes, I gave Toefl and Gre (Handed her the Toefl and Gre report). (Toefl -115)
VC: I see you have two attempts at GRE? 
Me: yes, I didn’t get good scores in Quantitative section in the first attempt so I waited for 5 months and gave it again. I improved my score by 40th Percentile ). 
VC: Do you have any family member in US?
Me: No. 
VC: Unfortunately, you have applied late for the visa interview. You’ll need to ask for another i-20 from your university. (Proceeds to give me a piece of paper saying Administrative Processing). 
Me: Okay thank you, have a good one. 
Administrative processing took 6 months. 
Got the visa. Now , I am a US and Canadian citizen. 
Was it worth it? Would I do it again? NO. 
Because it was too hard. 
I was stupid and ignorant. I didn’t know any better. I believe that’s why I was able to do it. Sometimes ignorance is a blessing in disguise. 
Over the last decade or so, I saw Pakistan going from bad to worse. Inflation, joblessness and despair increased far more rapidly than any other neighboring country. As an overseas Pakistani all I could do is watch from abroad. Because I’ll admit. It’s too hard to solve our own problems. People who tried to do it, are in jail these days. And really, all they wanted was to do something good for the nation. But I guess, I still have hope. One day to return Pakistan, may be serve my own people. May be…one day….
Reason for sharing this post- I do see rejections on this group. I do see hopelessness. Guys- trust me, never lose hope. This one decision changed my life forever. But I was mentally prepared to go to UK or Germany or stay in Pakistan. I had faith in Allah that whatever will happen will be for the best. 
The visa counselor did not like me. Infact , from her face I could tell that she didn’t like me at all. But Allah had my journey written here. 
Best of luck everyone and don’t lose hope.

Visa interview experience 
Date: 13 NOV 2023 
Karachi consulate 
Approved and Issued 
Q1: 
What's your course 
Ans: It's MS marketing analytics 
Q2: Why do you want to study this course
Ans: Having worked for over 4 years in the marketing industry I have observed a technological shift that requires me to have in depth knowledge in both advanced marketing and data analytics, with modules SQL for analytics which will allow me to analyze data in a matter of hours that takes me a week to do right now and data visualization 
Q3: The moment I said data visualization the VO straight away asked me a cross question ""so what is data visualization""
Ans: We marketers have to translate complex raw data from digital marketing campaigns into easy understandable presentations for our clients, stakeholders and most importantly decision making, this process is visualization 
Q4: why from Illinois Tech? 
Ans: IIT offers a research based module in electives that is in collaboration with IBM which is one of the biggest names in analytical tools and software so the additional certificate I will be getting along with the liberty to choose modules from the school of computer science like AI will enhance my portfolio.
Q5: How did you achieve this scholarship 
Ans: I had 3.6 CGPA in my undergrad and have a 4 year work experience so a combination of both was considered.
Q6: How do you plan to pay the rest of the expenses 
Ans: My father will be taking care of those expenses (explained his source of earning)
The VO went silent for 30 seconds, and then told me that my Visa is approved. 
We were very casual in our conversation, maintained an eye contact, I fumbled while saying ""collaboration"" and I literally giggled and corrected myself. 
Everybody is very helpful inside the consulate,  very accommodating, Stress is usually inside our heads, Trust in ALLAH and then trust yourself, be genuine.  
JazakALLAH. And may you all succeed in your ambitions. AMEEN.

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Embassy: Islamabad
Status : Approved
Applied by myself
After greeting, VO said my name and I nodded in response
Why are you going to US
I'm going for studies
You're going to Harvard. Great. What are you going to study?
Differential equations
Differential equations?
Yes, my concentration is differential equations although it says liberal arts on the document.
Why do you want to study these?
I'm a teacher and need to learn them so I can teach it to my students.
How was the application process?
(VO was asking about admission application and I thought he meant visa application) Most people said I should get an advisor or counsellor but I did it myself, didn't find it very complicated.
(VO interrupted) 
Did you apply and get accepted for it or just signed up?
I had to apply and go through the admission process.
OK. How do you plan to pay for it?
From my savings.
How much  do you have?
I shared the amount.
Are you married?
Yes
Any kids?
No.
Is your wife going with you?
No she's not. (I wanted to explain why, but didn't)
Have you changed your name before?
No, I haven't.
OK. It says you were Akmal (not real name) before?
My family calls me that endearly. It hasn't been my official name. 
OK I'm approving your visa. You'll get your passport in some days.
I asked how long it will take and he said its on the blue slip.
VO kept typing throughtout these questions and there were long pauses between questions. He didn't ask me for any supporting documents apart from the usual sevis fee, visa fee, DS 160 and Passport.
I was very nervous because he refused 3 people before me and only one approval. At the last minute I told myself that this person is a gatekeeper and I have to go to US nomatterwhat. I focused on why I was there and where I wanted to be, instead of focusing on people around me. Confidence is key. He could have refused me for my ans to last question but I clarified and was confident which I think helped.
ایسا لگ رہا ہے جیسے برسوں کا بوجھ ہٹ گیا ہو۔ 
I was refused visa for UK 4 years ago despite having an offer from University of Cambridge and it took me 3 years to save the money for this program.
I'd like to thank Tahir Haneef for helping me clear my doubts and for questions I had. I'd also like to thank you all for this group and the moderators. I did multiple mock interviews using different questions from previous posts here.
BTW nobody tells you about the whole gruesome process of going to shuttle stop, the exorbitant fee for it, multiple queues and security checks. The embassy building is daunting. Also, from the moment I stepped out of embassy to until I left the shuttle stop, every person I met asked me for mithayi after seeing the blue slip. I hope our workers learn some self respect and stop the begging.

Me:- So Sir, my school has a very comprehensive College Counselling program, I came to know about Union College through my college Counsellor and I applied to 10 Unis and got admission into 7 of those with varying degree of Scholarships .

(Big mistake)

VO:- Your fathers business is not showing up . 
( Gives a very scary look) 
Me:- Try *tells the real name*, you would be able to see my father and a couple of reviews. 
( i said something about the name being changed recently or because of the language thingy, I just spewed words I could think of )

2:- Go early, my interview was at 9 30 and I went in at 9 o clock and got into the embassy at 12. 
3:- Get atleast 2 copies of Confirmation letter and your Id card because they take those  before the shuttle service. And if you don’t have these you need to get into the line for photocopy and thats an additional 30 minutes. 
4:- The only options for the shuttle service was 3000 and 5000, and the lady said that I needed to take the premium service because I was getting late.
They try to sell the premium service but it not necessary at all because there is another line outside the embassy. 
5:- Don’t worry about the time , My appointment was scheduled for 9 30 and I was interviewed at 12 15 . 
6:- I had done a mock interview with my college counselor and read a couple of interviews in the group . I read the frequently asked questions mentioned in the post of a Mod. 
Allah Khair krsi.
I’m not an expert but if anybody needs any kind of help feel free to ask .

THE TRICK IS to be Confident and natural like these questions don’t even matter and don’t get stuck while speaking. Try to stay to the point and not give a comeplete story for every answer you give.
My Experience: I came alone to a place near the embassy to stay. At 1 am I realized My mother hadn’t signed my I-20 I forgot to tell her to sign it.
My friend photostated my I-20 from the call center I worked at and delivered it to my home. 
At 2 am my parents left from Peshawar to give me the signed form. Then they asked to drop me off even tho it was just 5:30, I agreed and found out The roads were blocked and we had to take a long route.
I found out no InDriver no careem no Uber were available at the time. So it was a miracle my family came to drop me off. 
If I hadn’t forgotten to sign my form, my family wouldn’t have had come to drop me off and there’s a chance I would have messed things up 
But Thanks to Allah almighty things worked out.
Moral of the story if it’s written for you it will happen if it’s not Allah has better plans for you. Try try again
Best of Luck everyone May Allah bless us All

A girl in front of me got rejected.
I was confident and a bit nervous but I was alright when I was on the counter.
I filled my DS-160 myself with the help of YouTube videos, did my whole process myself, made notes from google for the interview, took some tips from my brother and it was a lucky day for me.
Plus this group really helped me as well. 
I kept reciting some duas that my mother told me. They really helped me up being relaxed.
If your DS 160 is correctly filled, you've all the tests and required documents you're good to get visa.
