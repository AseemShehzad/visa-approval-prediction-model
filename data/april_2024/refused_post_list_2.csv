Me. Gave
Vo. 
Why usa
Me. I have placed usa universities in the top of my list because it is the most popular destination for studies among foreign students, usa has prestigious universities in the world. Degree obtained from usa has much more worth then any of other countries here in pakistan. They also offer practicle courses, flexible education and cultural diversity further enhanced the educational experience. 
Vo. what are you going to study
Me. I going to peruse masters of cyber security.
vo. Why this uni?
Me. UD offers students a real world education, besides that I was also in contact with my professor. she has worked in industry and also her research, work, knowledge and contribution to this department are exceptional which also matches with my interest. This made me select this univeristy.
Vo. why this course?
Me . I am already working as a security analyst in xyz company, which is not sufficient for me as it requires tremendous amount of knowledge and skills to analyse and stop digital threats. This degree is exactly my field. It will not only enhance my knowledge but provides me the expertise which I can opt in to my field to perform even better.
VO.  Who is your sponsor 
Me. my uncle is my sponsor and he is  resident in usa
Vo. What he do there.
Me. He was a international cricketer and also working in xyz company as a network security engineer.
He. How much he earns
Me. told 
Vo. why will he sponsor you and not your father.
Me. TBH I got my admission way earlier then I thought  so my father was not able to show the bank statement of last six months because we have such business where we reinvest our profits back to business every after 8 months and then we get profit 2 times more. So that's why my uncle is sponsoring me.
Vo. is he married?
Me. yes
Vo. how will he bear your expenses while having his own kids.
me. All of his kids are under 12 years of age. by time he will finance his kids education. I would be graduated till then. how ever he is rich and he can bear the expenses together.
Vo. what are your plans after your masters.
Me. I will get back to my country as i am already into a legal contract with a company where they offered me cyber security role with 2 times salary. also I got engaged recently so I'll.mary my fiance after coming back.

Hello everyone,
Recently my visa was refused. I was asked about my relatives in US, I told the VO about my brother. Then he asked about his university so I told him he is in the same university on J1 visa . After that he asked for his passport copy, to which I said I don't have it now. 
Then he asked about my dependant funds. I had personal funds which were sufficient only for 1 year. So the VO said its not enough for five years (as I m going for PhD). I said my father will 
support me in future but he refused my visa under 214b.
Now please tell me whether my visa was refused due to my relative in US or insufficient funds..?

Aoa all,
Yesterday my F1 visa was refused (214-b), I had a scholarship(sponser) from my cousin. He owns a company in NYC. My interview went very good. She refused my Visa after seeing the scholarship letter, no questions after that.
Today I went to a consultant, he told me that last year US made a policy that bank statements can't be used from a person in US. Bank Statements must be from Pakistan. (That's the reason for refusal).
Is 
it true ? Is there any new policy like that ?
Thank you.

I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that it's very hard to get cleared in second attempt but never loose hope and stay calm. 
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

Me: Sure Sir
VO: Put your right hand 4 finger on the scanner
Me: Ok
Vo: Why you were rejected last time?
Me: There may be many reason But in my opinion I was really nervous and confused So I could not explain
 my case & myself to VO And maybe that leads me to my refusal.
VO: Why you are going to US?
Me: I’m going to pursue masters in Finance from Illinois Institute of Technology.
VO: Why this you choose this University 
Me: While searching for different universities I found this university much more appealing because of flexible 
course structure they are offering me a blend of mandatory & elective courses, they also offering me extra 
certification courses of Business Mathematics & Calculus which will add value to my practical skill set.
Besides this the faculty is highly competitive as I have talked to some of the professors about they are much 
more focused practical orientation.Moreover they awarded me merit scholarship of $7,000.
VO: Why this course?
Me: As I have a bachelor degree in finance. So the course structure they are offering me has a unique 
combination of finance and technology which I consists of subjects like Investment MGT, Entrepreneurial 
Finance and Financial markets which are my area of interest. These courses will add value to my entrepreneurship
 and investment skills which help me expand my business.
Vo: Why USA? Why Not Pakistan
Me: • The course curriculum which I was looking was not available in my country which is Entrepreneurial Finance 
and Investment Management. US degrees have high values around the world. They are more focused on practical rather 
than theoretical. With Practical implementation & Multicultural Environment it will help me get more exposure. Getting
 a degree from one of the world class institution will increase my potential and skills lastly there is a big difference
 between course curriculum and faculty structure.

University: Utah tech university
Status: Refused 
Appointment date:15 Nov 2023 Islamabad 
VO 
just said next please and I went to the window and passed the documents no greetings or anything else.
VO:Why Utah tech university?
First of all this university gave me direct entry and allowed me to study this program without taking any perquisites or foundation so they saved my 6 months or maybe Upton  a year.
Although the university has its own dental hygiene clinic where I will be able to complete my 1 year residency. After these 2 reasons I took a pause 
VO:Are you going for a residency?
No first there is a 3 year study then we have to do a 1 year  Mandotry residency we may say a house job
. 
VO:Have you applied in any other university in US?
I have applied to two other university university of Minnesota and university of South Dakota but they refused as they don't offer this program to international students and university of Minnesota was just  offering 2 year program
VO:So why this university?
I have already told the main reason that they gave me direct entry and allowed me to study without taking any pre-requisite or foundation and secondly every academic year only 24 students get selected into this program it was quite tough for me to get admitt there and this also shows they are focused on quality of education.
VO:Who is going to sponsor you?
I have 32 thousand usd funds about 9 million PKR in my personal account which I have got from my parents, mother is a vice principal in gov high school and  father own a  business there combined income is about 13 million annually 
VO:How many employees do your father have ?

Although my brother is pledge to support me he is a dentist
.

Yes he has completed his dentistry from Pakistan and from past 1 year I am working in his clinic.

VO: 𝐧𝐨. 𝐈 𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮.

VO: 𝐢 𝐚𝐦 𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐲. 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧 𝐅𝟏 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐚 𝐢𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐚𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬.
I was completely shocked as my interview went for more than 15 minutes and he seemed pretty satisfied over my answers. Seeing me, He said SORRY again as i was leaving the counter. 
Haven’t been able to figure out what went wrong and how to overcome this. I have been thinking about my interview and my rejection non-stop since that day. Your suggestions and advisories are really appreciated.

Good afternoon everybody!
I was refused in April 2023 (F1 Visa).
Now I have changed my university and would like to appear for the interview again.
Unfortunately, I am not able to secure the date before 21st August 2023.
I 
booked the appointment in 1st week of September, I then talked to my university's International department in this regard and they were more than happy to provide me late arrival approval letter in case of attending the orientation and classes online on the zoom.
I consented and they provided me the late arrival approval letter of 1 month (20/09/2023).
Now I want to know if I could not secure the early dates, would I be able to satisfy my Consular officer with that letter?
Anyone with the same experience got their visa approved?
Please step forward and help me in this regard, I would be more than grateful to get assisted.
Thanks and Jazak Allah.
