Alhamdulilah! I 
got accepted to Fully Funded Masters 
Scholarship in Computer Science from 
Canada
 as well as 
America
.
HOW YOU CAN GET IT AS WELL?
1 line answer is: "" Good and Novel Research Work "" (Publication is not required).
A bit of 
detailed method
 (How I got the scholarship):
I have 
3.3 CGPA, and NO Publications
 but my research work is meaningful that I could write about it thoroughly in my Statement of Purpose.
Conduct good and meaningful research work in your home country (it means come with a problem and spend a few months or a year in solving that problem or problems in a good university or research lab under other professors, who can guide you).
Apply in Masters Thesis Programs only.
Write Statement of Purpose which should mainly focus on your research work and future prospects and reflects why this particular professor and university is the best match with your work (relate your work with prospective supervisor in the SOP, write his research paper titles and relate it with yours in 1-2 lines).
Get 3 Letters of Recommendations from your university (these letters should support and highlight your research work and what you have written in your SOP, it should not be generic at all (as most university professors give generic letters and they are useless).
Now, Choose universities you intend to apply based on your CGPA (like if you have just 3.0, then University of Toronto's scholarship doesn't make sense in your case) and follow these steps.
Visit Faculty profiles (related to your desired department of study), of let's say 20 different universities.
See the Google scholar and Personal Website of the Professors of that department you want to apply in. 
List down which 3 professors best matches with your research work and domain in those universities.
If there is no professor which matches with your research work, then do not apply in that university.
Write about his work and relate that to your work in your SOP.
Write him an email as well (after applying) that how his work was related and how you can assist him in his work and how his work fascinates you.
It would need you to read Abstracts of his recent research papers (to write, and relate such things in SOP)
Weightage to this method is 50% and 
rest of the 50%
 is Praying to Allah
Now Wait and be good to others. 
GREAT THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES AND HELP OTHERS.

Update: 
My F1 visa got accepted today. The VO didn’t ask me for any documents or bank statements. 
Hey!
my appointment is on 6th September and this will be 2nd interview at Islamabad embassy (got a refusal in July). The situation was different in my first attempt as I only had a scholarship of 25% and the rest of the amount was a loan from prodigy. 
Now 
in my second attempt I have almost 60% scholarship from the university and instead of loan from prodigy, my uncles are my sponsors (my mamu and khaalu) and my I20 only mentions a 12000$ family funding. 
I was refused under 214 (b) and the VO also showed a concern about my loan repayment. 
What do you think are the chances that I can secure an F1 visa in my second attempt with all the changes in my interview? 
P.S. I already have a valid B1/B2 visa which will expire in 2027.
Thank you

I recently accepted for fully funded PhD position.
On 17 April, I will receive my I20 form. The joining date to university is 1st June 2023.
Is it recommended to ask a supervisor to contact the US embassy to support my study visa application? So that application process will be faster.
Kindly guide me. Your help will be appreciated.

My F-1 visa got accepted today at Islamabad consulate, Alhamdulillah. VO just asked me the reason for going to USA and what would I do with my PhD degree in future.
However, my husband's (F-2) visa got into administrative processing due to his field in TAL and his current job. He clearly explained to the VO that he wouldn't be working in the states as he is not allowed to do so. VO returned his passport with 221g and said that there's nothing to be worried about, he just needs 
to upload his resume and publications list.
Has anyone faced a similar situation? If yes, how much time did it take for F-2 processing if F-1 was already approved?
"

I have a question? 
I have been accepted to one community college and 2 universities.
I have a study gap of almost 6 years but all of it is justified. 
One 
of the universities did ask and asked for my resume as I was working for the past 6 years.
I have my interview in the last of october. 
Any tips?

Greetings! 
A quick question.
I have been accepted to two universities. 
Ohio State University that costs around 50k a year
                                 Or
Indiana University Bloomington that costs 34k a year after 50% scholarship. 
Which one is better for getting the visa?
Jazak Allah

I got accepted in University of New Haven for MS mechanical Engineering 2022 Fall.
The university has emailed me the acceptance letter only. They said that in 7-9 days, I’ll be informed whether I got the scholarship or not.
They asked me for the Financial documents like band statement and affidavit to proceed with my I-20.
My 
question to this group is that:
What will be the process after I get my I-20?
I have zero idea about it.
Please guide.

Hello, 
I'm in urgent need of guidance. 
AlhamdulliAllah, I have been accepted to Carneige Mellon University for a Masters in Public policy and Management with a 40% tuition scholarship. But I'm still concerned about paying for the reminder of my tuition. I come for a middle-class family and my parents cannot afford it due to the volatile USD/PKR exchange rate. 
Can someone please guide on what should I do? or help me find any external funding? 
Is 
it a wise to opt for a student role?
I'll appreciate your response!

AOA to all of you.
I've been accepted by a professor for PhD program at the University of California, USA. I need your feedback on an important matter. The guidelines state that if you've studied in an English medium, you don't need an English test like IELTS or TOEFL. I reached out to the professor, who advised me to ask the graduate admission director, but I haven't received a response. I then contacted the graduate student affairs officer, who 
confirmed that I don't need to take the IELTS.
I'm a bit concerned about whether I should proceed without the test. The application deadline is December 1st, and need a 7-band score. Will this decision impact my application negatively? Your insights are much appreciated.

I've been accepted into the University of South Dakota's MS program and previously applied for an F1 visa in February 2024. Unfortunately, my application was rejected. I've since made several adjustments for my 2nd attempt:
-I haven't listed my Master's degree. (That i already persued) As double masters is red flag.
-I've reduced my work experience.
-I've tailored my job descriptions for the program.
-I've included my current job details.(Which i wont during my first attempt)
I'm unsure whether to hide my Master's degree in this application. Any advice or other suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.

Hello,
I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s graduate program (in NYC), with a financial aid award that covers tuition, Bard-sponsored housing/accommodation, and health insurance. However, expenses related to travel and food will not be waived and I’d be entirely responsible for managing them. Moreover, the program does not have any on-campus jobs/employment (I’m not allowed to live/work off-campus) and I would quite literally be on my own. I wanted to write here 
to ask for advice: Should I say yes to this offer? Is it possible to be a bit too frugal in New York and save money/stop myself from needless spending? Would I be able to manage? How can I bring down the remaining costs that have not been covered by my financial aid award? Any sort of assistance/piece of advice is welcomed.
Thank you very much.

Hello.
I have been emailing professors for positions in their respective PhD programs since April but have not gotten a positive response from anywhere. Then, a few days back, my application for a PhD program in one of the universities got accepted. Now they're asking me to upload my documents etc. How is it possible that none of the professors accepted me but I still got in? What do I do about the funding? I called the uni and they said all TA positions are taken. Everywhere 
on this group and the PhD holders from USA around me are saying that PhD is always fully funded. What am I supposed to do? I'm still emailing the professors that haven't responded from that uni.

A dumb question:
Should the physical photograph submitted to the consulate on the interview day match the picture uploaded for your DS-160?
The 
picture uploaded for my DS-160 was snapped professionally with a mobile against a white wall in my home and was successfully accepted. So, should I get this picture printed from a picture studio, or can I get a new one snapped in a different attire?
Thank you!

I am from Pakistan. I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s Masters program, and received a financial aid award that does not cover personal, food and travel expenses (along with other services and amenities). I wanted to write here to ask about alternative sources of funding (both International/American and Pakistani) that could help me finance my graduate study in the United States/at Bard and cover the remaining costs. I have spoken to their financial aid

Hi, I recently got accepted at a school in chicago for a psychology program(Masters) 
I had a couple questions, if anyone of you can help me out a little.
1- My current school is around 13k per semester; however i dont want to start studying here. Im just planning to use their i20 to get visa. Since they have a low acceptance rate, im assuming it’ll be helpful in getting the visa through them. 
Is 
it possible that i transfer to a community college before even starting my semester at my original school? 
(If yes, are there any you guys can suggest?)
2- Should i apply to these community colleges from pakistan( right now) or when i come ? (Given that i do get my visa approved) 
3- Can you give me a step to step guide as to how i will be able to transfer right away ? If anyone has been through the process, id love to hear your experience. 
(The community colleges i checked have a deadline of august 15th for fall 2023) 
4- Can i work off campus on my very first month of coming to the states or am i only allowed to work on campus( given that i will not have a SSN initially) 
Any other piece of advice you can give me, id love to hear it. Please help a sis out 
 
Thanks!

Hello,
I have done MBA in marketing 2020 and now I am willing to pursue my Ms in Business analytics from US.  Visa officer could most probably ask me  about why double masters. I need suggestions regarding this question since my interest area is business analytics and wanted to enhance my skills and expertise in this field but I don't understand how to logically answer this question.
Furthermore, I want to know how higher the chances are of visa approval for the candidates of 
double masters.

In second window my biometric was done
Then i waited for another 20 mins for my turn for final interview. My interview guy was bald man and he was older in age.
VO: Why are you going to US?
Me: To do my PhD in Nutrition 
VO: Why this university?
Me: I have worked a lot on nutraceuticals and superfoods. When choosing a university i wanted that my phd research is also around one superfood. So now I’ll be working on soy beans. Also the courses here at UMN are those that i am already familiar with but still need to gain technical expertise in. Like food analysis and food safety. And i have heard minneapolis is a beautiful city.
VO: ok ok and who is funding you?
Me: HEC
VO: I see that its partly funded by your university.
Me: Yes partly funded by university and rest by HEC so its completely funded.
VO: okay great. Congratulations. Enjoy your stay. Read the rules…… (couldn’t hear anything further as i was already crying almost)
I took the blue slip, my documents and almost ran out of the hall (as if he would catch me and give my passport back 
)
I was confident, i made sure that my answes are related to my research and reflect me and not any general answer. This is the key i think. Thank You everyone for all the support that I got.

Dear Group Members,
One of the professors from University of Florida has accepted me to enroll in a PhD project under her supervision. The project is fully funded. Also, she has offered me to work as a teaching assistant at the department as well. 
Currently, I am clueless about the next steps (e.g., Visa processing and documentation). I would really appreciate if you all could guide me on the following points:
1) 
What type of visa options are available in my case? I am married and would take my spouse with me.
2) Besides degrees, passport and acceptance letter, what other documents would be needed?
3) How long does the whole process take?

Hello and Eid Mubarak!
I'm planning to go for my post-grad studies this Fall-23 and have been accepted by the University of San Francisco in their Energy Systems Program. The University has offered me a $10k scholarship for the whole academic year, and the rest will be funded through student loan (cos I don't want to use my PKR savings to fund my studies). 
Total per annum expenses are (incl. living, and other expenses) $50k. (I will be showing proof of funds of around 30k; 20k 
savings account and 10k scholarship)
My questions from the community are:
1) would there be any issue in the F1 visa processing? 
2) Do i need to show complete Proof of Funds of $50k? Or should i tell them that part of the cost will be funded through student loan?
3) I'm funding my education from my own savings. My family won't be supporting me (coz they don't have that much money or source of income). I have 6 years of professional working experience. 
Your help is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Hello everyone.
I would really appreciate your valuable suggestions on my current situation. I have been accepted into the University of South Carolina, Columbia, and had a visa interview scheduled for March 10th. Fortunately, the interview went well, but I was informed that my visa application was refused under section 221g. The Visa Officer has requested additional documents, including a detailed study/research plan and its practical application. (Attached)
I have already 
contacted my potential supervisor, and he has agreed to provide a letter stating that I will be working with him in his research group. The graduate director will be providing this letter in the upcoming week. However, it has already been three days since my visa interview, and I am concerned that submitting the documents late could cause issues.
I would greatly appreciate any guidance or advice on this matter from those who have more experience in this area.
 Thank you!

Hi everyone.
I got offered to join Masters in Data Science at the University of Connecticut, Storrs, for Fall 2023. I just accepted the offer and paid the enrolment fees. I've been instructed to submit an official transcript and degree diploma/certificate.
As I still need to get my degree and transcript attested by the Higher Education Commission, I fear the documents still count as official and will be accepted.
Further, if anyone is currently enrolled or aiming to join the 
University of Connecticut, please connect to help me with the process as I proceed.
Thanks.

Hi everybody!!!
Today, I received my degree’s evaluation from World Education Services(WES). I am gonna share my experience with you. 
Most of the USA’s universities requires you to submit a copy of your foreign education evaluation through WES. 
They will ask you for this report during process of your admission application. 
Timeline:
Business Day 1: WES received the Documents. 
Business Day 3: All received documents are correct & no additional documents are required. Started working on report/evaluation. 
Business Day 6: Report is ready and dispatched to mention address/university. 
Required Documents:
I sent them 10th, 12th, and 16th grade verified result cards and degrees in sealed envelope. 
Cost: 
It cost me $228 basic. $32 + shipping for each university.  
I got equivalency of USA 4 years bachelor’s degree. My CGPA didn’t change at all.

Hello everyone! 
I would really appreciate your advice on a few matters. 
Firstly, my husband has been accepted into Harvard Law School for his Master's degree, with an 85% scholarship and the rest is the loan offered from the harvard law school. I wanted to inquire whether I need to apply for an F2 visa right now, considering I already hold a visit visa valid for 5 years. I don't intend to stay with him throughout his 9-month Master's program. However, I want to ensure that it 
will be easy for me to convert my visa once he secures employment. Or will there be issues since I didn't convert it immediately?
Furthermore, I wanted to ask if we can book an appointment for an F2 visa before receiving the I-20 form. Additionally, what are the wait times for this process? I'll be in Islamabad, so we will be scheduling the appointment there. 
Please inform me of the estimated duration of this process. Thank you.

VO: Hello. Pass me your documents.
Me: Sure officer. (passed passport, I20, DS160 confirmation, SEVIS confirmation)
VO: Okay, so why are you going to the U.S.
Me: Officer, I am going to the U.S. to pursue my MS at Carnegie Mellon University.
VO: Carnegie Mellon University (impressed). And what degree?
Me: Robotics
VO: Okay (became serious after hearing robotics, and started typing on his computer).
VO: And what was your undergraduate degree in?
Me: Electronics Engineering
VO: What other schools did you apply to?
Me: Officer, apart from CMU I applied to the University of Pennsylvania, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, New York University, Boston University, Arizona State University, University of Maryland College Park, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, University of California San Diego, and Northwestern University.
VO: (Paused typing and looked at me) And how many of these did you get admitted to?
Me: I got admitted to all of these except Northwestern University, for which I am waitlisted currently. 
VO: (impressed upon hearing my admits) Do you have your resume with you today?
Me: Yes officer, I do. (passed my resume to him)
VO: (glanced over my resume, and then continued typing something on his computer).
VO: When is your program starting?
Me: 14th August 2023
VO: And what are you exactly is taught in the program?
Me: (Explained the course structure and overall work I will be doing).
VO: Do you have a course plan with you? Or what courses you will exactly study?
Me: (Shared individual courses including core courses and elective courses I plan on studying during my time).
VO: (Didn't respond, typing something on his computer)
VO: Okay, and who is going to fund you? (looking at my I20)
Me: (told)
VO: Do you have your proof of funds with you?
Me: Yes officer, (passed the documents).
VO: (glanced over my financial documents, then placed it to his side, and continued typing. Then got up from his seat with my documents and went to the back and fetched a white paper which was the administrative processing document)
VO: Okay, so what do your father and sister do (sponsors)?
Me: My father is a neurologist over here in Karachi, and my sister is a general surgeon in the UK.
VO: So, why are you going to study after all these years? (I graduated back in 2018)
Me: Well officer, the field that I am currently in, i.e. Computer Vision and Robotics are evolving at such a fast pace that its nearly impossible to keep up with the state of the art. And given that I have been out of school for the past 4.5 years, I think its high time that I go back to school and brush up on a couple of fundamentals and update my skillset.
VO: Okay. (Picked up my resume and started going through it).
VO: So are you on a H1B visa currently? (my current employer is based out of Redmond, Washington)
Me: No officer, I work remotely as a foreign contractor under the title of Lead Research Engineer.
VO: Okay so you work on Machine Learning at Retrocausal? (mentioned on my resume)
Me: Yes officer, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. We basically design vision systems for our customers like Ford, Honda, NASA, PACCAR, Apple, etc.
VO:  (started typing on his computer. After a while returned my CV and Return offer letter from Retrocausal, continued typing, and then returned my financial documents as well)
VO: Okay. And what is this NED on your resume?
Me: Officer that's the name of my undergraduate school.
VO: and is it over here in Karachi?
Me: Yes officer.
VO: What universities did you get admitted to? (he asked this question again, in my opinion, he wanted to cross-check whether I was BS'ing about my admits which obviously I wasn't)
Me: Officer, like I mentioned earlier, apart from Carnegie Mellon University, I got admits from University of Pennsylvania, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, New York University, Boston University, Arizona State University, University of Maryland College Park, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and University of California San Diego. And currently, I am waitlisted by Northwestern University.
VO: (continued typing for the next 30 seconds)
VO: Okay so, further documents are required for your case so I cannot approve your visa just yet. I am returning your passport and a list of documents that I have marked. You will have to upload these on the portal, the link of which is mentioned on the form. If your visa is approved we will email you on how to submit your passport.
Me: (taking my passport and the 221(g) administrative document) Okay sure officer, thank you for your time.
My personal takeaway:
a) Be honest. As I stood in the line after my biometrics I overheard a couple of ongoing visa interviews. It was clear that they weren't being honest and aboveboard with the VO, and the outcome was that they got rejected.
b) Be confident. I know a lot of people have this latent tendency of being anxious when speaking English, that too in such a formal setting at the US consulate where the stakes are high, but this is something that could very easily be mitigated by having your story straight (The what, how, why, and where).
Best of luck to all the others in AP and all those prepping for their interviews. God Speed!

Hello dear students!
If you're a Pakistani student dreaming of studying in the USA, I urge you to reconsider choosing 
New York City (NYC)
 as your destination. While NYC is glamorously portrayed in movies, it's important to see the full picture before making a decision.
Here are a few reasons why NYC may 
not be the best choice
 for Pakistani international students:
Financial burden: 
NYC is one of the most expensive cities in the world, both in terms of tuition and living expenses. International students pursuing MS in NYC can expect to pay between $15,000 and $45,000 per year in tuition alone. Living expenses can add another $1,000 to $3,000 per month.
Limited Graduate Assistantships (GAs) and On-Campus Opportunities: 
NYC is highly competitive, and many international students face challenges in securing graduate assistantships or on-campus job opportunities. With a large pool of students and limited positions, it can be challenging to find these opportunities to help cover your expenses and gain valuable experience.
It's essential to explore other states in the USA that offer has higher likelihood of on-campus job opportunities.
Part-time job struggles: 
Many Pakistani students in NYC work part-time to help cover their expenses. However, these jobs are illegal and often low-paying and have limited hours. Additionally, some employers may exploit or mistreat international students.
Housing woes: 
Finding affordable and decent housing in NYC can be a challenge, especially for women. Crowded apartments and subpar living conditions can become a health concern.
Mental health and well-being: 
The fast-paced and competitive environment in NYC can take a toll on students' mental health. 
There are many other states in the USA that can provide a quality education without the challenges that NYC presents. Consider states like 
New Mexico
, 
Oklahoma 
where tuition fees are lower, living expenses are more affordable, and there are more on-campus job opportunities.
I encourage you to make an informed decision about your study destination. Weigh the pros and cons carefully, and don't be afraid to ask for help from your family, friends, and advisors.
Additionally, I encourage students who are currently studying in 
NYC to share their experiences and thoughts
. Your insights can be incredibly helpful for upcoming students, providing them with a better understanding of what to expect and how to navigate the challenges and opportunities that NYC offers.

Hello everyone, 
Im in a bit tough situation. I got accepted into my top choice which is Columbia university NY. But i didnot get any financial aid. I reappealed but dont know what the outcome is gonna be
Now the situation is that i have around 25k USD saving and prodigy finance is willing to give me loan of 88k but the whole degree will cost me around 180k. I contacted Agha khan foundation for the scholarship but unfortunately i got my acceptance on 14 March and to apply for 
their program the last date was 15 March. 
Is there any external funding you know which i can apply to or any other solution for my issue.
P.S: its not like its the only school. I have acceptance from 4 other schools in Europe with funding but Columbia’s program is more alligned with my carrer choices. Plus its my dream school.

I have some questions in my mind, your response in this regard will be highly appreciated
1) Is USA a good option for Phd in Biotechnology and for future career in Biotechnology?
2) How to start my scholarship hunt? Should i start contact with supervisors from now for the coming september intake? What i have to specifically mention to the supervisor in the email? Should i make a proposal as well incase if the supervisor ask or i should leave it?
3) Need some good suggestions about universities for biotechnology having high acceptance rate? Or how to shortlist universities for admission? Any criteria?
