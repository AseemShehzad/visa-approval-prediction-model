Hi everyone, 
I appeared for f2 visa and unfortunately it's rejected. Interviewer was lady in Islamabad embassy. 
I need some suggestions to improve for the next time.
Here are the questions that she asked. 
1st 
question:  What is your spouse studying?
Ans: He is doing his PhD from .... university majoring in ...... Engineering 
2nd Questions: when did you guys got married?
Ans: we got married on .... 2023 
3rd Question: how did you guys meet? 
Ans: Mam he was my first cousin so we both knew each other from childhood 
She said something about cousins marriage that I didn't understand because she was not audible to me. And she rejected. 
For F2 visa I don't have anything to change in my visa application. Mostly in the posts people say that VO starts interview by asking that what did you change in the application and why it was rejected last time. I don't have proper answers for both of these questions. 
Please give me your suggestions.  Thanks.

Guidance required from seniors
F1 visa rejected on 7 Dec,2023
Applied through a consultant. He took Rs.6 lacs, a big blunder I made to apply through a consultant. He took assurance to get me a F1 visa 100%. I know that were fairytales(US dollar machine, billionaire, odd jobs then pay your fee, send money home)
One 
of my relative referred him and now he has become stranger too.
Consultant is asking to pay appointment fee again.
My profile:
No bank balance
No proper job experience(in my father’s business and already done with Mba. Consultant didnot show my MBA, and I applied for another Mba)
My situation is quite financially vulnerable
Savings: 1 million PKR
My plan was to get study visa for future immigration. Not for study purpose.
Should I go for another attempt with this profile?
Or 
Should I go for Middle east to find jobs, earn money then again apply for F1 visa??
How to get my credentials from consultant,i.e: US DOCS ID Passwords, etc.
I have wasted the whole year 
Really required your suggestions.

To the people getting rejected: I know it may seem like that you are rejected for no reason and many of you have posted sharing your concerns that you are rejected and have expressed your frustration too. So let me explain you the major reason. Before I explain you the reason let me tell you that I have received two F visas and one J visa with no travel history before my first visa. Currently I am doing my PhD. So one of the major reason is Finances.
Let’s be honest when you 
show bank statements, are you really going to be using those finances? And VO knows that! They know that the 70 lacs you are showing many of you don’t intend to use that money and just showing it to get the visa. After you get the visa, you will start thinking how you will pay for your education. So if you don’t have a full-ride or a loan, or a TA or RA ship you won’t be able to pay for your education. Don’t be misled thinking that you will be able to make sufficient money with an on-campus job, the on-campus job is only sufficient enough to pay for some of your expenses such as food, bills and sometimes rent. You can’t pay tuition and health insurance with a part time job and working full-time or working off-campus during semesters is ILLEGAL! Majority of you are rejected primarily because of your finances because your finance story doesn’t make sense. VO knows the cost of living in US, and cost of tuition, they are mentioned on your I-20. So they are well aware that you won’t be able to furnish this amount and the bank statement that you showed is probably just to show so you can get that visa. 
Yes, not getting the visa is disappointing. But it will be more disappointing once you get to US and can’t pay for your expenses. So again if you don’t have a full-ride, A TA/RA offer or majority tuition scholarship, don’t think that you will be able to manage the finances. 
Hope this helps and clears some doubts. Don’t blame the embassy or the system because if you are eligible for visa, you will get one but if you know deep down that “I am just showing these statements to get visa, I won’t be using this money” than know that VO knows this and you won’t get the visa. 
Best of luck!

I was rejected for this upcoming fall semester. 
To improve my application, I need to find a good ranked university.
The MS programs I am looking for are
Data science
Data analytics
Business Analytics
Computer science
Unfortunately my CGPA was 2.95. But I have a over 2 years of relevant work experience. Hence looking for names where i can get accepted with the CGPA and without mandatory GRE.
After my research many universities are saying that they might consider, but they usually don't. Had the same experience last term alot of money was wasted on application fees.
I will be very thankful if someone suggest me good universities with good rank for the spring semester.

Alert 
My visa was rejected third time yesterday. 
I went for 3rd attempt after 45 days since second attempt. 
Visa 
officer said I can't give you visa because you were rejected two times before but I give you one advice, "" Don't waste your 185$, you will get same answer. Just give yourself some time "". 
Note: I changed universities in all three times. I knew this could be red flag but i thought as long as i have explanation, it won't be an issue. And I was laid off two months before than interview. So I appeared unemployment there but had two years of work experience. 
Question: I have to wait but how long ? Even if i waited, there is strong possibility that i won't get visa because now i have three rejections.  
I'm going to start my another job soon. 
I'm thinking for Fall 2024. 
What else should I do ? 
I'm worried even if i change my profile and waited, still they may reject by seeing three rejections. 
Betray by seeing rejections but don't want to give up. 
Please give me suggestions.

Students before me for undergraduate programs were rejected and one student for masters degree was accepted only. 
Me: Good Morning officer!
Him: Why this course?
Me: I chose bs business administration as i belong to a business related family, my father and brother both are successful businessmen, i have interest in business as this course will enhance my business skills as ill learn about all aspects of business including economics, marketing, supply chain and information system 
He gave a smile, seemed like he thought i was confident abt my program like know how, and stood up took my passport inside and came back
Him:Why this university?
 I did an internship at an educational consultancy where i got to know about university of UTAH then i did my research and got to know about unique majors that university is providing and big campus situated in 1526 acres, diversification of students, support system for students, i got scholarship of 35000$ across 4 years and last factor was location, which is salt lake city, it is one of the liveable cities in US and top preference for international student because of the business opportunities.
Passed me my docs with rejection slip and said sorry you’re not eligible for the visa under section 214B. 
Can anyone guide me where i went wrong as I cant seem to understand with only two questions how he rejected me. My D160 was perfect also funding and my family ties are also good as I’ll have to come back to takeover my family business. 
Ps: i applied on basis of my o level grades

Interview Advice for those who got rejected in first Attempt.
You may go with the same university but not with the same profile. VO will must ask you what circumstances have you change this time?
Circumstances mean ur academic, professional, financial or personal circumstances…University is not ur circumstance. 
Try to identify the reason of rejection, improve ur profile accordingly and then apply again with a gap of minimum one month for next attempt for same intake
Re-apply 
with no change in ur circumstances would be a waste of time and money.

Well 
I won’t right down the conversation here unlike others. But i will say they are doing completely piece of shit out there. It’s a total crap. I invested more than 2 months in this whole process and all I had to bear was extremely reluctant behaviour at the counter.

During the interview the VO asked me about my bank statement, i showed it to her and then she goes where did all these funds come from?

She said do you have the statement for the family savings account, I didn’t had it with me that time and after two three questions she rejected 
my visa. also note my father opened this account in December 2022 , do you think this could be the reason for rejection?

For second attempt I applied to many universities like Miami University,University of Michigan-Flint,University if Colorado denver,Texas A& M University and got offer from 3 of them yet,but I changed my subject to Bachelor of accounting to show strong 
home ties to the visa officer because my elder brother is also a Chartered accountant.
Is it a good step to change subject and university both for second attempt?Need guidance from seniors,Thanks in advance.

Program Master in Engineering Management 
Indiana Institue of Technology.
I have 3.05 CGPA in bachelor.
I 
was first sponsoring by my uncle and he is a US citizen... 
I was rejected in interview.
I have taken admission in university in the same state where my uncle lives.
Now, for 2nd time, what can I do? 
Can I change university and go with the same sponsor or not? 
Actually, my father in Pakistan has no cash money in bank and all are invested in property.
So, I have no bank statement in Pakistan 
So, if I arrange 50,60Lacks from invester so I must pay 2.5 Lac to him

My visa was rejected twice in 2021(transfer student) when i was still in 5th semester of my University doing bachelors. Now I've completed my undergrad in 2022 and have an year experience with Toyota in my field. 
Should I reapply for MS/MBA. Seeing that I wasn't granted visa two times, will the VO make sure i don't get it third time? 
I have property and apartments on my name. I run a business too and have a full time job. 
Need 
some guidance, Kindly. 
I'm highly confused. 
Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

Interview date = 11 Aug
Location = Karachi consulate 
Status = rejected 
V.O= young Chinese man
Time slot = 9.00 am
University = NYIT, Manhattan campus
Scanned passport and fingerprints
VO started looking at computer and then looked at me. He repeatedly did that  3 to 4 times. Then he asked 2 questions only. 
First Question = Why did you apply to this course? 
Answer = I have previously done BBA and now I'm planning to do MBA in order to polish my skills and expand my father's business in the global market. 
2nd = How did you find this university? 
Ans= I had previously done BBA from Lahore and now wish to study abroad for a global mindset, specially in a metropolitan city. So I searched for MBA program on Masters portal amd filtered my search for New York. (VO said Ok). I found a bunch of high ranked universities and then studied their ranking and course structure (VO said Ok as if it was enough) and this university matched my requirements. (Again Ok). Also,... (I was speaking in my flow but I realized that he had basically stopped me at this point. So I said Ok and stopped).
He asked me to go back and sit.
After some time I was taken into a seperate room where a Pakistani consular came and talked to me in Urdu.
I greeted him and he straight forward started like consider this a chance for yourself. I kept on agreeing with a smily face until he asked me which consultant did you use? I disagreed and told him that I had done everything by myself. However,  I have seeked some help from a friend as in discussions but nothing else. He continued this interogation for quite some time but my answers remained the same. He told me that I had matching profile with a lot of other candidates and that he has been dealing with them regularly. In fact, a lot of stidents with the same profile had come earlier and agreed that they used a consultant. I told him that a friend of mine has also come here with me and we have discussed things together if that is what you are looking for. But he remained insisting that there were many and that they've agreed to a consultant. I never agreed and he let me out and after some time, I got my passport back with white slip(214B).rejected.
Previously, my friend (whose appointment was at 8 15) was also interogated but for a longer duration than me. He claims that they showed him the exact location of the consultancy on computer screen. This did not happen with me nor he showed any other proof.
Also, I'd like some suggestions if I should go again with the same profile or change university and then apply for the next intake (January)? I'd really like to go in this intake but not sure if I'll be rejected again since I can't change my uni at this point!

Aslam alikum 
I have my 2nd interview attempt next week. Got 1st attempt rejected in this may.
Everyone please pray for me.
And I wanted to ask that can I take my own statement of 10 to 15 days, would it be OK? Because they dont have any limit of days for statement,  plus would it be a problem if I take 2 statements, 1 mine and 2nd my mothers? 
Which statement do you recommend taking?
Is 
there a possibility that if I take my statement only, they would get a hint of me not returning? Rejection under 214b?
