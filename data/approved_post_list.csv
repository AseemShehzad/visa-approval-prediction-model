Visa Approved in the third attempt!
Sharing this experience as a hope for many of you guys who will be appearing in their third attempt. I was refused twice in May and June from Islamabad Consulate. I applied again with the same profile after deferring my admission in the Karachi Consulate. 
I was refused first time around for showing myself self sponsoring my education even though I wasn't doing any job and my father had given me the funds back then too. It was a blunder from 
my side in the first attempt. 
2nd time around, the interview lasted only a minute, before visa officer refused me without asking any major questions. It was quite tough to gather the confidence for applying again after such an interview. 
Interview on 26th October.
University of Houston.
Master's in Industrial Engineering.
Karachi Consulate. 
Visa officer was an American Male in his 40's. 
When I reached the counter, we greeted each other and after that there was a pause of around 2-3 minutes without Vo asking me anything as he was going through my profile. 
Vo: Tell me about your parents.
My mother is a housewife. My father is an industrialist, we have have a business of manufacturing of adhesives and lubricants which my grandfather started 50 years back and after him his sons are managing it now and also the reason why I want to do industrial engineering, as I have to comeback and manage it afterwards.
Vo: In how many uni's did you apply?
I applied to a total of 5 uni's, out of which I got accepted into 4 of them. I applied to Clemson University where I got rejected from, and I got acceptances from UIC, USF, FSU and UOH where I'm going. Among them I choose University of Houston because Houston is a big industrial city and UOH has strongly industrial affiliated faculty. There are couple of professors at UOH, who take their students for industrial visits every week as part of their curriculum which enhance their practical knowledge which I'm looking for. 
I was quite animated at this moment and was making some hand gestures which annoyed the Vo. He asked me to stop doing that and answer him as I was talking to a friend. 
Vo: So you have one brother who is handling your family business? (I don't know where he got this from)
I told him that I have two elders brothers and they are also handling the business and well.
Vo: Have your brothers also studied from aboard?
No. They have got their education in Pakistan. 
Vo: Why do they want to send you abroad?
Told the visa officer how many brothers always wanted me to get the exposure and how they have always encouraged me to pursue education from abroad. I did an Aiesec internship in 2019, mentioned that too.
After this the Vo stopped asking questions and tried to make a decision but he was undecided at this time. I asked him I could help him with anything else but he said that he is not sure either way right now. I asked him should I tell him about why choose Industrial Engineering in the first place. He said no and that I would have read the website and would just pour it all out on him. 
I said no, just let me explain why I wanted to do Industrial Engineering.
Told him about Industrial Engineering and how USA is the pioneer of this field and that only a couple of uni's in germany and canada are offering this course with the same curriculum. Also mentioned that I have acceptances from Canada and Australia as well but I choose USA because of their quality etc.
Vo: Did your Visa also got rejected from Canada and Australia?
No. I didn't apply for Visa there, as I wanted to study Industrial Eng and my courses were different there.
Vo was still undecided trying to make a decision.
Vo: How big is your industry.
Told him about the number of people working there.
Vo: Okay, tell me about your time at Turkey.
Told him about Aiesec and how this internship gave me exposure and boosted my confidence etc. 
Eventually, the Vo handed me the blue slip. 
Vo: Enjoy your time in the USA.

Please Admin approve my post.
AOA to all of you.
I've been accepted by a professor for PhD program at the University of California, USA. I need your feedback on an important matter. The guidelines state that if you've studied in an English medium, you don't need an English test like IELTS or TOEFL. I reached out to the professor, who advised me to ask the graduate admission director, but I haven't received a response. I then contacted the graduate student affairs officer, who 
confirmed that I don't need to take the IELTS.
I'm a bit concerned about whether I should proceed without the test. The application deadline is December 1st, and need a 7-band score. Will this decision impact my application negatively? Your insights are much appreciated.

The atmosphere was very comfortable, and seeing that made my confidence boost. I spoke with the Visa Officer in a friendly manner, as if I was having a conversation with a friend. I had prepared long answers, but during the interview, I only spoke when necessary and avoided giving unnecessary details.
I want to tell all of you that feeling nervous is valid. It's okay to be nervous, and that's completely normal. Just don't stress out. I can't express how nervous and stressed I was, but once I was there, the environment made it easy, and I was able to manage my nervousness. One more important thing: hold on tightly to your faith in ALLAH. Our success is not because of our efforts alone, it's by the will of Allah. Get close to Him and put your trust in Him. Pray Tahajjud and Nawafil, and have faith in every aspect of your journey. They really helped me stay relaxed.
Additionally, this group also played a significant role in helping me. If your DS-160 form is filled out correctly, you have all the required tests and documents, then you're on the right track to get your visa.

VO: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Me: I have one younger brother.
VO: What do your parents do?
Me: My mother is a teacher at XYZ school and my father is a government employee in the ministry of XYZ as an Assistant Officer.
(He got a little confused at assistant officer, I had to tell him again and also mentioned my father's grade to him)
For a minute or so he kept typing something on his computer. And after a minute gave me my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation back.
At this point I was thinking that he didn't give me my passport back to me but then I saw him taking out a blue slip and eventually kept my mouth shut 
VO: There you go. (Not even a congratulations 
)
Me: Thank you. When can I have my passport back?
VO: You will receive an email in a week or so.
Me: Alright. Have a nice day. 
He only asked me 4 questions out of which I guess only 2 were relevant to my interview. He didn't ask for any single document other than my I-20 and SEVIS fee confirmation. I stayed confident, and maintained my tone but all of that wasn't even looked at 
. He already refused 2 F-1 candidates right infront of me and I was really scared but Alhumdulillah everything went far better than I expected. 
My question now is, how long will it take to get my passport back and when does the visa status on the portal gets updated??
Any questions are welcomed.

BUSINESS ANALYTICS (MS)
INTERVIEWER: INFAMOUS ASIAN
NO GRE
NO IELTS
GPA 2.86
Date: 8th June.
DISCLAIMER: My interview was very different from others so please don't take it as a guide as I don't want to mislead anyone.
After preparing myself for straight 20 days I went for an Interview, I was prepared for every kind of question, but there was something else written in my fate.
VO DID NOT ASK ANY COMMON QUESTIONS LIKE:
Why US? 
Why this university?
Rather he started like this
1) what are your daily responsibilities in your current job?
2) what does your father do? (Convinced with my one word ANSWER)
3) what are your plans after graduation? (Told him the names of 3 it companies name where I'm aiming to work at)
4) do you have any relatives? I said yes because I didn't want to lie
5) will you leave the current job? I said yes (btw I just joined that job 20 days ago)
Conclusion: All that time he was behaving as if the decision is already decided because he seemed too uninterested to hear my answers. It was like as if he was just completing a formality nothing else.
In a nutshell, for me US F1 VISA IS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON LUCK BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A HEC FUNDED PHD LEVEL GUY GETTING REJECTED WHOSE PROFILE WAS 4X STRONGER THAN MINE.
BUT GO WELL PREPARED AND BE CONFIDENT. I ALSO GREETED HIM IN A VERY LOUD VOICE. Also don't forget to pray and take your mother's prayers as they can do wonders.
GOODLUCK!
Thankyou 
Rana Ibrar
 for helping me throughout this journey.

1st Attempt: Approved Alhumdulillah.
Interview was at 25th May Karachi Consulate.
Profile: BS from LUMS, going for MS Finance at University of Houston. Had Received out-of-station tuition waiver and additional scholarship as well. Have been working at Multinational bank for almost two years now.
VO: 
Pass me your passport and F1.
VO:  Why university of Houston?
ME: Firstly, the courses which they are offering, related to derivates trading and hedging and this is where my professional experience lies, as I have been working in the banking industry for over 2 years now, and I feel this degree would help me fill in the gaps in my skill set.
Also, one of my university professors had recommended this course and degree, as he had also completed his master’s from there.
Also, I have been following Professor XYZ, throughout my undergraduate phase, and read his publications on hedging techniques, so I thought it would be quite an experience to take live lectures from him.
VO: interesting!
VO: What is your job ?
ME: Told him about the general job description, routine tasks etc.
VO: Plans after graduation.
ME: Obviously, the plan is to complete my master’s with good GPA. And then to focus on my banking career, as employers in the Pakistani banking sectors tend to value those profiles and individuals who have done their education specifically from US Colleges. In fact, my current supervisor had done his Master’s from abroad, and at a very young age he is doing quite well. I have a similar objective, I believe this degree would help me to excel in the Pakistan banking sector, also that I have made good repo with my supervisor, he would be willing to hire me at a senior position, once I complete my master’s.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME:  it is my father.
VO: What is his profession?
ME: He is a banker as well, and currently working in one of the banks in UAE.
VO: Pass me the statement.
I handed over the statement to him.
VO: Your credentials are good, I am approving your visa. You will get your passport in a week.
For all the aspirants out here, the only thing matters is your level of confidence and communication skills. Regardless of the circumstances, and whatever is the outcome, just give your 100% and maintain eye-contact.

Embassy: Islamabad
Date: 12 May
Visa Status: Approved
I was a bit nervous and none of my answers went 100% smooth.
Here's how interview went.
VO: Hello(in very friendly tone)
Me: Hi
VO: (After taking my docs and entering them on PC) Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going to attend Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Cincinnati.
VO: (After a pause) Why did you choose this University?
Me: (I stuttered during this answer a bit) I am going because this university is aligned with my research interest.
VO: Why did you choose University of Cincinnati specifically?
Me: Because the lab facilities and faculty is suited to my research in additive manufacturing. It's the same research that I did in my bachelor's. (stuttered here too)
VO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father. (I stopped after saying this for around 20 secs and then started speaking again) He is manager at X and makes Y money through job Z money through rentals and some money thru real estate trading which I don't know how much is.
VO: Cograts. Enjoy your stay at united states.
Me: Thanks.
Thoughts? 
The visa doesn't mostly depend on the interview. The VO wasn't even listening to me with attention. It depends on your uni, course and any funding you have(I had $20k scholarship). My interview wasn't the best. Actually, I would say it was average or below average.
Almost all visas(5/5) got approved before me. Only 2 were refused, who went after me. Those 2 had genuine reasons to refuse. If I were VO, I would even refuse them(not cuz of hate lol but their case didn't seem strong on paper)
Suggestions?
1. Don't go for consultants. They apply for you at few unis which VOs are aware of. VOs don't even consider you in that case. They straight away reject you.
2. Take IELTS. Take GRE. Secure full/partial scholarship(you can easily get it). Then go for visa. You will get it InshAllah.

VO: How exactly did you hear about this university? 
Me: Okay so there’s an interesting take to it, when I was in my final year doing my research, I mainly cited Professor Clyde Phelix’s publications and research articles for my thesis. I even asked for his help when I was stuck at one point in my research, and he was of such great help through emails. It is now my dream to work in his lab and have him as my supervisor and continue my research.
VO: What research did you do?
Me: I explained him about my FYP in 3-4 lines
VO: Hmm sounds interesting! So do you have any relatives in US?
Me: No sir I don’t have any immediate relatives however, my father’s distant cousin lives in Maryland I think .. I ‘m not sure.

Me: Yes sir! I have done my bachelor’s in biological sciences from _____ university and my major was immunology
VO: When did you graduate?
Me: I recently graduated in February 2023. 
VO: The entire time he was looking at his screen and hardly maintained eye contact
Me: I actually graduated Summa cum Laude in my batch
VO: Still staring at the screen, and said so who’s funding you?
Me: So my father is sponsoring my education and living expenses
VO: What does he do?
Me: My dad is a businessman affiliated with the real estate. He owns a construction company. He’s constructing a commercial plaza and alongside he constructs houses and sells them.
VO: How many siblings do you have?
Me: I just have one younger brother and he’s nine years younger than I am.
VO: Kept typing vigorously and staring the screen.
Me: I do have bank statement and my transcripts with me in case you want to see?
VO: Yeah okay sure I’ll check It anyway.
Me: Hands him the documents
VO: Did you give any standardized tests?
Me: Yes sir I gave IELTS only, because GRE was waived off but I was fully prepared and actually intended to give it though! 
***Okay so now he did something weird and I was like what’s he doing***
VO: He raised my transcripts, bank statement and other documents in the air and turned around to show the documents to 3-4 people sitting behind him. 
Me: I kept standing quietly and kept observing
VO: He kept typing for about 2-3 mins! Those 3 minutes felt like 10 mins I swear
Me: Silently praying in my heart to Lord that pleaseeee after this much lengthy interview please just save me the hassle and give the blue approval slip to me already.
***After 3 mins he hands me back my i-20 and seriously says***
VO: Make sure to show this at the airport
Me: I understood his hint but waited for his approval
VO: Congratulations I’m approving your visa! Good luck with your research make sure you do come up with an innovative way to tackle your research problem. Best of luck for your future and do remember to collect your passport on time
Me: I passed a smile! Said my thanks to him and left.
Sorry for the long narration 
 it had to be done! Once again I’d like to thank this group for providing a platform and for helping me in my journey.

Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence

F1 Visa Interview Experience, 26th September 
Karachi Embassy  
1st Attempt, Approved and Issued 
Illinois Institute of Technology, LLM Spring semester 2024.
It 
was a smooth process from start to finish.
Vo: Good Morning, pass me your documents.
Me: Good morning, here.
Vo: Why you are going to the USA?
Me: I am going for my master's LLM from IIT.
Vo: How many universities you have applied to?
Me: I applied to 4 universities and got accepted to 3 of them with 25-50% scholarships, and one of them hasn't gotten back to me yet.
Vo: So you are going for a master's in science? (I think this was a trick to confuse me).
Me: No, I'm going for my master's in law since I did my undergrad in law.
Vo: When and where did you get your undergrad degree?
Me: From the University of London in 2021
Vo: Why don't you have a UK student visa stamp on your passport?
Me: I did my LLB via an affiliated institute in Karachi.
(During this time, she was checking my passport).
Vo: Have you ever traveled abroad?
Me: Yes, I've been to the UK and Saudi Arabia 
Vo: You got a scholarship and these are your family funds, right? (Pointing at my I20)
Me: Yes, (My total funds were more than the expenses listed on the I20).
Vo: OK, who is going to sponsor you?
Me: My father will be sponsoring me and explained all the details. 
Vo: Does your father have a visa?
Me: Yes, 
(I thought she was talking about the UK visa at this point, but she was asking about the US visa. Corrected myself and told her No).
Vo: What are your future plans?
Me: My plan is to come back and start my own practice here in international law. 
Vo: OK, I am approving your visa. You’ll get your passport within a week and here’s the slip.
These are a few tips I learned from my whole experience.
- Do your paperwork from filing your ds160 to the interview appointment. I made a slight mistake in my ds160 and changed my form before the interview. 
- Be confident during the interview, it matters a lot. They scrutinize the body language and attitude of the applicant. 
- If you're not sure, ask around in the group. I posted many times with my queries and asked members for help.
- Reach out to the universities repeatedly for your concerns, they’ll help you in every way possible.
- Watch Argo Visa Interviews, they are so helpful and accurate. 
- Take this interview as a normal interview. It’s a normal process. Usually I overthink things, but the day before the interview I stopped myself from reading interview posts and anything related to it. It eased my nerves a lot. I was way more relaxed than my family members lol.
- And the most important thing is to pray and make lots of dua. InshaAllah you’ll be fine.

F1 status: Approved Alhamdulilah MashaAllah 
Date: 24th June 2023
Interview time: 9:15am
Actual interview: 11:45am 
Karachi Consulate 
Although there were few minor mishaps that happened too that day but i tried to remain calm and relaxed throughout and managed to convince the VO to approve my visa Alhamdulilah. At first i wasn’t given any token number and when i realized that i have no token number, i went back and got token number of much later time 
 Next, i was instructed to bring another passport size photo from the nearest studio as early as possible as my current picture wasn’t acceptable since i was wearing a hijab and some sides were not visible (according to them). Anyways, i went to the nearest studio (Dosani’s) and came back after an hour. And waited half an hour more to have my interview. 
I greeted him, he ignored and had a straight bezaar face. VO was a male. He asked me to pass my documents. I did. 
VO: So why are you going to US
Me: To pursue dual Masters in public informatics and urban planning from Rutgers University, New Jersey.
VO: Hold on, whats public informatics? Is it related to public health? 
Me: No its not related to public health, its related to data analytics. I tried explaining him the relevancy of this field with my field and how it aligns with my bachelors degree. He was listening me carefully and even typed it on his computer and i think read it online too on Rutgers website. I even mentioned few data related courses like GIS, Envi, python and he was like now whats GIS? So I explained him in detail about that too. 
VO: Okay so i see you have also gotten a 60% scholarship. How are you managing remaining funds? 
Me: My family is going to sponsor my education; that includes my father and two brothers. 
VO raised his eyebrows and looked at me.
I gave him my father’s background and of my brothers background. He asked me to pass their financial documents. He carefully saw each of those documents and verified the amount that i was stating while telling him about my father and brothers earnings and savings. I also told him about couple of investment lands that we own and their worth in dollars. 
Vo: Whats the status of your brothers in US?
Me: One of them is on H1B and another one has just started his professional hybrid masters program. 
Vo: Okay and what are your future plans? 
Me: Told
By that time he already took out a paper which i didn’t see which color that was. But he seemed satisfied and was smiling. 
Me: Last but not the least, one interesting fact is that when i first visited USA back in 2020, I got the chance to explore the campus of Rutgers New Brunswick, so this was also one of the reasons of selecting Rutgers apart from scholarship and its outstanding reputation. I am familiar with the place and have explored the campus for days. 
Vo: Thats wonderful. Congratulations i am approving your Visa. Im keeping your passport. Thankyou. Bye bye 
Me: Thankyou so much. Have a nice day. 
My advice: Be confident and well prepared. And dont be hideous at all. They already know everything about you and I could’ve said something else on the question of my brothers status but i chose to be honest and straightforward. 
Best of luck to everyone. Prayers for all. 
Allahumma Barik

VO: congratulations your visa has been approved you can collect your passport on next Friday.
I might have missed some of the qs but the interview lasted for about 5 minutes. The VO seemed already annoyed and he had rejected 2 people infront of me and was not in a good mood. He was constantly looking at the computer screen. After each question there was a break a long one aswell. I couldn't catch anything from his expressions. I prepared myself as much as I could but it was mostly because of my prayers and faith in Allah. I would advise everyone to do the same. First prepare yourself fully and then trust Allah's plan. I felt very bad for the refused people but there's a reason to HIS plan. 
Any questions are welcome.

Me: ok thank you.
THE TRICK IS to be Confident and natural like these questions don’t even matter and don’t get stuck while speaking. Try to stay to the point and not give a comeplete story for every answer you give.
My Experience: I came alone to a place near the embassy to stay. At 1 am I realized My mother hadn’t signed my I-20 I forgot to tell her to sign it.
My friend photostated my I-20 from the call center I worked at and delivered it to my home. 
At 2 am my parents left from Peshawar to give me the signed form. Then they asked to drop me off even tho it was just 5:30, I agreed and found out The roads were blocked and we had to take a long route.
I found out no InDriver no careem no Uber were available at the time. So it was a miracle my family came to drop me off. 
If I hadn’t forgotten to sign my form, my family wouldn’t have had come to drop me off and there’s a chance I would have messed things up 
But Thanks to Allah almighty things worked out.
Moral of the story if it’s written for you it will happen if it’s not Allah has better plans for you. Try try again
Best of Luck everyone May Allah bless us All

Masters in Engineering Management
Interview date: 16 June 2023
Time: 8:00 AM
VO  was a lady in her early 30’s
Me: Hey! Good Morning Mam
VO: Good Morning, How are you?
Me: I am Fine, what about you?
VO: I am fine too. Thanks for asking. Pass me your documents.
Me: Sure.
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going to pursue my Masters degree in Engineering management from XYZ University.
VO: Which degree have you recently completed?
Me: I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from XYZ University in karachi.
VO: When did you graduated?
Me: I graduated in October 2022.
*She was constantly typing on computer, there was 5-6 seconds gap after this question, so I started telling her that when I was in USA  in 2021, so I visited this university physically and met the ABC professor and ABC Professor, they both cooperate with me so much, and Dr. ABC gave me whole university tour, and also show me the research facility of Engineering management including all labs.*
VO: You were on your pleasure trip so why did you go to this city? As it is not a tourist city. Did you just go to specially visit this university?
Me: No no, I was on tour of Las vegas, los angeles and Orlando but in last I visited this city because my cousin live just 30 minutes away from this city, and he was giving me tour of beaches and several museums, during that I saw this university and planned to visit it on other day. My cousin is also a F1 student, studying in XYZ University.
VO: Oh Ok! So you were visiting your cousin in that city.
Me: Yes Mam.
VO: In how many universities did you applied?
Me: I just applied in this university, because I have physically visited this university so I was well aware of this university and city. As my CGPA is …….., so you know there are few better universities where we could apply.
VO: *nodded her head* Yes, you are right.
Me: As there is no consultant involved in my case, all I have done by my own after doing proper research between few universities. Rather than wasting my money and time by applying to several universities, I just focused on few universities and finalized this one. I also got a scholarship of ……… amount.
VO: You have done a good job! So what’s your plan to do ahead, I mean in which sector do you want to do certifications or job?
Me: I want to go towards the sustainable energy sector, as my FYP was also regarding that so I have much information on sustainable energy. 
*I explain here my FYP in few lines*
VO: Interesting. So tell me about your masters degree that is there just generally engineering management or you have to take any selective sub-field in that?
Me: In this university, there are several sub-field under engineering management, such as robotics and automation, supply chain management, civil engineering focus, Industrial Engineering focus, Mechanical engineering focus and chemical engineering focus.
VO: So, what you are going to pick?
Me: I will choose mechanical engineering focus, as my bachelors is in same field so I have a vast knowledge of it.
VO: Right! Why did you want to do masters degree?
Me: If I would be just having bachelors degree so it would be having not that much worth. If I want to get promoted to higher level so I must have a masters degree too. Well, I selected this program rather than selecting same program as my bachelors, the main reason is that if you want to go to management level post like to the highest post like CEO, so you must have management degree. What mostly engineers do is that they pursue simple MBA for this reason, and I think that if I would be doing MBA which is a business degree, after my BE Mechanical, so it would be like that I am throwing my technical field degree in dust bin. Therefore, I choose this program which is combination of management and engineering fields.
VO: Ok, right! What are you doing right now like are you studying any course or doing any job or something else?
Me: I am currently working in XYZ company as a mechanical engineer, you may see in my application that I have written NO in job section because when I booked my appointment so till then I was unemployed, but after 2 days of it I got a call from my CEO for vacant position of mechanical engineer. This is the same company where I had done my 2 months internship in month of December and January, as I was having a good working relation with my CEO so I asked him during my last days of internship that if there would be any vacancy of engineer post so he must let me know. I’ll be going on study leave, and it has been granted to me along with surety that when I will be back so I will be promoted to XYZ post due to my masters in engineering management. Do you want to see those letters?
VO: No, I don’t want to see anything, just you tell me verbally, its ok.
*she was constantly typing, so to gain her attention I start talking about my Exchange program trip to USA in 2016, where we were guest of University of Toledo, after hearing this she start talking to me again*
VO: So how long was your trip?
Me: It was just for 15 to 16 days, and I also got just 20 days visa for it. You may see it in my passport.
VO: Yeah, most of the time for exchange program, only limited time visa is granted. So, when you were in that city where you are going to do masters, what did you like there and what did you didn’t like?
Me: I love it, the calmness, its nature and the people are so much caring and lovely. There is not a single thing which I could say that I didn’t like. 
VO: Not a single thing! There must be anything that you may have thought that this shouldn’t be like this?
Me: No mam, seriously, there is not a single thing like that. That whole city is amazing.
VO: Good. Ok! (She start smiling ) So I am approving you visa. Good luck for your trip to USA. Hope you will like it. Well, we are also conducting pre-departure orientation ( she gave me blue slip along with the orientation pamphlet), I would suggest you to register yourself and must attend this, it would be helpful. 
Me: Sure Mam, I will definitely come to attend this. Thank you so much.
Me: Bye mam, have a nice day.
Vo: Thank you, you too.

Status: approved (I had a prior refusal in 2022 in B2)
Appointment time: 7:45
The 
embassy was quite empty when I arrived and I believe I was the 4th or 5th person in the interview when counters opened.
Visa officer was a young American lady and pretty nice and friendly.
VO: Good morning! How are you doing?
Me: I am fine thank you for asking. How are you?
VO: I’m good. Why are you going to US?
Me: I’m going there to pursue my masters in business analytics from the University of Central Oklahoma.
Me: alright! Why did you choose this uni?
Me: Actually my sister referred this university to me initially since she is already studying in the US and then I researched about it from my end as well. I found the coursework to align quite well with my future goals because I plan to join the banking sector of here as a business analyst and there was this specific course of predictive analytics I really wanted to study since it is quite useful in the banking sector and UCO offered it so I went with it and everything seemed good. I also scored a partial scholarship.
VO: Ok so two of your sisters study over there?
Me: No my elder sister is studying over there only.
VO: And what is she studying over there?
Me: she is doing her associate in nursing.
VO: who is sponsoring her?
Me: my father.
VO: so he is also going to sponsor you right?
Me: Yes entirely
VO: What does he do?
Me: He is a senior executive at a bank over here.
VO: which bank?
Me: Bank of Punjab, it’s a government bank.
VO: what is his exact grade?
Me: Executive vice president.
VO: Nice. Do you have any travel history?
Me: Yes I went to Saudi Arabia in 2016 with my entire family and recently went to UAE in December 2022.
VO: Great. Do you know anyone else in the US?
Me: not from my fast family but my brother in law is also over there.
VO: I see. (Spent almost 30 seconds typing something on the computer and then came the final verdict)
VO: congratulations your visa has been approved. Thank you for coming. You will receive your passport in almost a week. Have a nice day.
Me: Thank you so much. Have a nice day!
The overall time of interview was 4-5 mins I think at max and the entire time, I tried my best to stay confident and keep a nice smile on my face. The officer was quite understanding and took interest in what I said. Also, main thing is surprisingly all 3 people before me and 2 people after me got their visa accepted.
This group honestly helped me a lot in the preparation and even though I was quite nervous till the end (because I had a few weak things in my case; my sister was studying in the US, her daughter was born there and is a US national, my entire family already has valid visas, I have been previously refused), I believe I aced the interview. 
Also, ARGO Visa’s Youtube channel is honestly very very useful.

Thanks.
Important points you should consider before applying for the F1 visa.
1)If you going for studies in the USA then you have to do the entire process without the support of any consultant, otherwise, your visa will be rejected.
2)You have to be very confident while you are communicating with the visa officer.
3) Your dress matters a lot, always prefer to wear simple and dark-colored clothes for the visa interview.
4)Always try to work on your grooming if you are planning for the visa interview (Beard, Hair Cut, Hair Colour, and Clean Shave) Everything should be up to date.
5) Try to keep a smile on your face while giving the interview.
6) If you do not know how to apply to a US university or even how to apply for a visa then you have to select the other country, USA is not the right place for you. Your input really matters.
7) Stop giving answers in YES or NO (Your answer should be at least one line).
Thank you so much Rana Ibrar and Mahwish Moazzam for your continuous effort and support. That was impossible without your assistance. God Bless you.

 PLEASE APPROVED
Hello everyone I hope you guys doing well I just want to confirm few things before my interview... Need your suggestions seniors!!! 
1) My marksheets are not attested from HEC, my university didn't ask for it, is it necessary for visa? I completed intermediate 
2) 
What if the amount we show in a bank statement for i-20 is taken out from the account and put it back  before interview date..so is it fine? My father is a business man and that's why he never hold cash for a long time in his account. 
3) can I use the same bank statement which I used to receive i-20.

Colleage:(by looking at letter of support) Who are these to you?

(The hall went completely empty, I was the only one except guards. Shortly, VO came to the counter)
VO: Ok so, you can take these documents back and we've approved your visa. (Passed me the blue slip while smiling)
Me: thank you. (Smiled back)
VO: Enjoy your stay with your family. (Said happily)
( For most of the time, she kept looking and typing at the screen. Didn't look at me for longer than a second or two during each of my answers. Also my answers were brief and to the point so she didn't have to look for long either.
I kept an eye contact during the whole interview and also maintained a bit smile throughout my interview though it went quite long and I had to wait a lot in between too.
I had a plus point of already having a visit visa so I used that in start while answering the question of why I chose that uni. As I heard that the VO may have not gone through all your data so you should convey them such info yourself.
Though my answers were not in detail but i did prepare myself for any type of detail. I made a list of all possible questions and prepared the detailed answers then filtered out the important information only.  Saved the detail for only the case if they themselves ask me to go into.
You should definitely have all the information about the university you're applying to. They should not get the idea that you've selected a university without doing any proper research)

VO: Your visa is approved. 
The interview was of one minute at max. I had an upper hand because of being a issued a tourist visa earlier but most people were getting accepted that day. 
A few pointers for people who would be applying:
- Aim for universities that have a QS ranking of under 500. 
- Apply to multiple universities (3-5) as it shows the student's interest in studying. 
- Try applying to a field that is related to your current work experience or undergraduate degree. 
All they really see is the student's authenticity and his ability to come back after studies. If they have any doubt about the student staying there or going to earn money, they will reject your visa. 
All the best, may Allah make the process easy for everyone.

FALL 2024 USA BACHELORS STUDENT and future BS applicants
So my visa got approved yesterday for bachelors in CS – The University of Southern Mississippi (100% tuition fee scholarship)
A lot of people have been asking me about how I received multiple scholarships for BS programs within the United states.
Three reasons
1- GPA (1088/1100 in matric | 4 As in A’ levels)
2- SAT (1360/1600- 700/800 in Math 660/800 in English)
3- Extra co-curricular activities (President of debating and declamation club, led an NGO of interfaith abuse and violence, tree plantation/ration packages/water filtration plant in Cholistan drives, internships and blah blah)
So I’ll lay out the process for Fall 2024, if you want to receive a 100% scholarship and more.
I currently have a 110% scholarship from USM (100% rn. will get additional 4k in July), 100% from Stetson University, Presidential award from Siena College and Founders Scholarship from Ferris State University.
Step 1: START EARLY
I cannot emphasize how much starting early is important in order to receive a scholarship. If you’re going for Fall 2024 then you should start your prep this summer.
I, as a fall 2023 applicant, took my SAT in August 2022. I applied to all of the universities that offer full scholarships BEFORE OCTOBER 1, 2022. 
Yes. A year early. A lot of universities have strictly mentioned on their websites that their scholarship will be given to students who apply before a specific date. It’s usually October 1.
There are three options you can apply:
 
ED (Early Decision):
 It is a binding decision. If you get into that university, you are legally bound to go to that university. Higher acceptance ratio
EA (Early Action):
You apply early. Deadlines around a year before the start of the semester. It is non-binding. High acceptance ratio. Less competitive. More chances of hefty scholarships
RD or Rolling (Regular Decision):
 Deadlines around 3-6 months before the start of semester
Step 2: SAT
A v basic thing: NO SAT = NO 100% SCHOLARSHIP (unless you’re able to prove you’re Einstein ki aulad and shit). Even though the option of going SAT optional exists, there are hardly any universities that offer handsome scholarships to SAT optional students.
The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It’s also used by universities in Pakistan like LUMS, IBA, NUST, etc. Based on a bit of advanced English and almost matric wali maths but theoretical so cramming won’t help.
1500+: you have a good chance for Ivy league and other top 25 universities
1450+: Merit based full rides and 100% scholarships
1360+: 100%+ scholarships
See? A lot of universities offer merit based scholarships. Meaning they don’t care what you did in your school, they just want your GPA and SAT score.
Step 3: Reach out and research
It’s never a shame to ask queries that can help you. Join groups on Facebook like this one and COALI. Post your queries. Ask for help. People are always willing to help.
Research about universities and scholarships. Go to Reddit r/intl2usa and check it all out. Check which universities offer aid to international students. CSS or IFSAA. Check for fee waivers. Everything is available. Just reach out and research.
Step 4: Apply
Use commonapp or scoir to apply.
Step 5: Write essays and stuff
A lot of universities require you to write essays that reflect what you are. Hire a counsellor if you have money (4-8 lakhs) or use CHATGPT or freelancers to write your essays if you’re not exceptional at descriptive writing
Attaching a sample below that I wrote for Villanova University
Villanova University
Question:
St. Augustine states that well-being is “not concerned with myself alone, but with my neighbor’s good as well.”  How have you advocated for equity and justice in your communities? 250 words
Answer draft:
“He is a Shiite; do not eat with him”. 
I was unable to conceal my shock and disbelief as I struggled to comprehend and process the ""advice"" I had just heard. I did not interact with the ""reliable advisor"" at the time, but later, I kept contemplating about what had happened to me and my friend. This was the first time I realized how prevalent sectarian and interfaith prejudice and hatred was in the community around me, and how frequently minorities were subjected to such horrific discrimination, hate, and prejudice.
The more people I spoke to and read about, the more heinous the world seemed to me. Because I was unable to stomach the internalized hatred that my society had so casually instilled in itself.  My moral conscience had always prohibited me from treating anyone wrongfully because of their ideologies, faith or race. I was aware that this was wrong and that I needed to take action. I collaborated with the ""Hifz-o-Amaan"" Foundation, an NGO working to reduce sectarian and interfaith violence and injustices. As the campus ambassador, I promoted tolerance and raised awareness regarding religious extremism by arranging events with minority groups, visiting churches on Christmas Day to exchange gifts, and hosting joint activities with them. I was aware that spreading awareness and love, one person at a time, may treat social diseases like this of hatred and prejudice because indeed, it is the people are that constitute society.

Interview: 16th June 2022
Interviewer: A lady
PhD Civil Engineering, University of Kansas.
Morning Mam,
VO: 
Morning
Questions:
What's University name in US? 
KU
What's your Major? 
Civil Engineering
Why were you in China? 
Study
Was that on scholarship? 
Yes
Had a same major in China?
Yes
Which University in China? 
Told
What's your proposed research in US? 
Told
So you have an assistantship, who's is your supervisor? 
I told her the name of my supervisor, she searched the internet and she asked me to spell it because she couldn't find it.  Then I passed her the CV of my supervisor and when she saw his profile, she searched on the internet again.  After typing a few seconds, she told me that, ""I'm approving your visa."" Congratulations.
#Tips
: Be confident and answer to the point, no need to explain. 
#Experience
: If you are having travel history and an assistantship then the interview is just a formality.
#Feeling
: I was feeling excited but once the shuttle bus driver and some other workers saw the ""approval slip"" in my hand they asked for ""Methai"".  I ignored them once but they kept asking for methai which was very annoying.  They have no ethics.  I spent 4 years in China and this was my second day in Pakistan after 4 years.  I saw many beggars on Islamabad road's and even in the embassy office today.

Got my F1 visa approved on my second attempt today alhamdulillah.
First visa attempt:
https://m.facebook.com/groups/1541028822851688/permalink/3483379868616564/?mibextid=Nif5oz
Second attempt:
I stumbled a lot in reply to the first question and was sure that the visa officer would reject me again but it didn't happen this time. 
I believe it was because I answered all questions in relation to how the degree would help me in Pakistan.
Here's how the second attempt went:
Visa officer: What school are you going to?
Me: xyz school (not mentioning some details for anonymity) for a master's degree in business analytics.
VO: Why are you going to this school?
Me: I'm going to this school because the program they offer teaches information in the context of business first. As I plan to start my own business after coming back, a degree from this school would help my plans a lot. (Stuttered a lot and got confused and barely gave a coherent response but this was the gist of it).
VO: You only applied to this school?
Me: Yes. I was going to apply to abc school too but I was procrastinating and then I ended up getting accepted in xyz school. It was my first choice anyway so I didn't apply to the second school.
VO: Why did you choose this degree at xyz school?
Me: Like I mentioned previously, I plan to start my own data analytics business after coming back and because this degree teaches skills in the context of business, that's why I am choosing this degree.
VO: What business would you like to start?
Me: I have been working for x type of companies for the last 5 years. I plan to start my own company in this field.
VO: How did you find out about this school? Not many Pakistani students apply here.
Me: I spend a lot of time on a data science community online and I saw an ad in that community of the university. I researched the program and it appeared to be aligned with my interests so I chose to apply here.
VO: How will you sponsor your studies?
Me: I have a scholarship of x amount. The rest is through self-finance. I have been making a salary of x per month which I've saved. I'll use that to pay for my degree.
VO: Can I see your bank statements?
Me: (passed my statements) Btw my brother has also agreed to sponsor me in case I run into any deficit.
VO: What does your brother do?
Me: He works in the data science field and lives in Saudi Arabia.
VO: Do you have any relatives in US?
Me: Yes, my brother lives in Chicago. 
VO: Is he an immigrant? What does he do?
Me: No, he's not an immigrant. He's an engineer at x company.
VO: Your visa is approved.
I had to remove a few details but I'm fairly certain that the reason why I got a visa this time was because I answered a few times why this degree would help my future plans. I have given a brief summary in my answers but I know that I talked about my future business at least 3-4 times and how this degree will help me start that business.
Some tips:
1. When the VO asks you why you want to go for this university, try to answer the question in a way that ties back to your plans and how this school will help you achieve the plans. Your answer should mention that this school will help you gain __ skills which will help you do __ when you come back to Pakistan. This school is the best option of gaining __ skills hence why you chose it.
Last time, I gave a generic answer (this university has a good ranking, the program teaches machine learning etc etc). The VO didn't even listen to my full answer.
2. Stumbling in the beginning thankfully didn't hurt my chances. I was stuck quite badly in the first answer and thought for sure the VO will have a bad impression but that didn't happen, so if this happens to you, don't lose your cool and try to answer the rest of the questions as confidently as you can.
3. In my DS 160, in the section where you're supposed to explain if you have gotten any rejections in the past, I wrote a whole essay.
I mentioned how I had been sick at my last attempt and that affected the way I answered my questions. I mentioned that I failed to clarify my sponsorship and didn't explain why I had resigned from my job so that got me rejected. I gave all explanations in that essay. 
I don't know if it helped me or not but the VO this time asked me no questions about my first rejection so maybe it did?
4. If the VO asks you if there's anything new about your application this time after your first rejection, always say yes and try to give information you didn't give them the first time around.
Watch Argo Visa and Mandy's videos on YouTube and try to have a planned strategy before your interview.

Status: Approved (2nd Attempt) 
Embassy: Islamabad 
In my first attempt, they didn’t ask me many questions and while being financially strong with all good answers, my visa was refused. I have also mentioned my experience in a previous post. I applied again a week after my first attempt. 
VO: 
Good morning 
Me: Good morning officer, I have to say something about my
Previous experience. 
VO: yeah sure go ahead 
While being a genuine student with good financials and strong travel history my visa was refused.
(Gave him all the details of my facts; Father’s business and my future prospects) 
He stopped me there after listening to me for a good minute or so. 
VO: ahan… okay so why USA?
Me: it is a land of excellence with alot of opportunities. It has new technologies and practical based studies through it’s advanced curriculum. 
VO: What does your father do? 
Me: Mentioned again here about his media production house business. 
VO: How many employees? 
ME: 2 dozen 
VO: where are you working now?
Me: I’m working at ____ as an electrical engineer.

Me: Mentioned about my duties

VO: checked the details and started typing 
While he was typing I also kind of told him he looked good in Shalwar Kameez 
 
VO: okay… so you’re visa is approved! Good luck! 
I believe if you have a good profile and strong financials, one should definitely go for a second attempt right after the refusal. I was not sure at first as I heard many people saying that I should have a semester’s gap between the next interview date but I knew I had a strong profile and I was just unlucky.
Alhamdullilah things went great and my visa got approved in second attempt!

They literally listen to your jargon even if it makes no sense lol. My sister lives in USA, but they didnt even ask me about her neither they asked for any other documents. 
Ek din pehle kisi dawat mai chale jaana taake uncles aise personal sawal tumse puche so that u know exactly what to answer. Thats exactly what i did lmao. 
Best of luck everyone.

Interview date = 15 Aug
Status = approved 
V.O= long beard man
Time slot = 10.30 am
First Question = how many admits you got
Answer = i got admission in 3 out of 4 universities in which i applied. Unfortunately wasn’t able to make it to university of rochester. Also named the universities and their business schools in which i got admit
2nd = why this xyz university 
Ans= Told MSBA at xyz is ranked among top 100 MsBa programs in the world according to Qs rankings. Also told in detail about the diversity of curriculum 
3rd= how many brothers you have
Ans = told 1 and also about his profession
4Th= who is financing you
Ans= told i have got scholarship of about 5K and have personal savings of around 8k and the rest of cost which is almost 43 k is going to be paid by my father. 
He asked about his business and i gave him the details 
5th= he asked me about my mother’s sister who lives in US
Ans= i told him that i have no immediate relative but about other relatives I already had mentioned in my Ds-160. He didn’t bother about it because she lives in different state than the state in which I have got acceptance..
Conclusion = 
Before the start of interview i had got the confidence that I would get visa because VO gave quite time to a student before me and listened him comprehensively before rejecting his visa so i got the feeling that if he gives me that chance i ll have the chances to get the visa. No doubt it is game of luck . And also the VO who is quite young was also giving alot of opportunity to speak . Women VO had more interviews from non-F1 categories and she put most of these cases to administration processing

---
VO: Please pass your documents. (She spent a lot of time looking at her screen and my I20.)
VO: Why the US?
(I feel like I fumbled here but I just answered how the US is the best at research and my program and that’s why I want to pursue my masters there at (my uni))
VO: Why (this uni)? (it’s in the top 20 of my grad program, btw)
(I gave my reasons and I also mentioned that I talked to current students and alumni.)
VO: How many people did you talk to?
(I told her about the students I talked to and the staff at uni I talked to, as well as the information seminars I attended.)
VO: Why this course?
(I talked about my major, its application in research, and how im interested in pursuing a career in this field.)
VO: What kind of research?
(I told her the kind of diseases im interested in studying.)
VO: What diseases specifically?
(I told her about the two diseases im interested in researching that are also prevalent in my community.)
[P.S: I had experience managing these diseases as a doctor.]
VO: Where do you work currently?
(I told her my job title in clinical research and my work place)
VO: What do you do in your job exactly?
(I elaborated on my duties in my current job.)
VO: How will this course help you? What kind of career can you have?
(I elaborated on how research is something ive already been involved in since my undergrad years and im continuing that. And I told her the several different jobs I can get here in Pakistan. And how it’s a step up from my current work and job title.)
VO: Where would you find these jobs here (in Pakistan)?
(I told her about the place I want to work at in my city and the person there im interested in working with. I also mentioned my current workplace.)
VO: So you’re a medical doctor?
Me: Yes
VO: When did you graduate?
Me: three years ago
VO: Where did you graduate from?
(I told her my university name.)
VO: Where is this college?
Me: Here in ___ (my city) right next to the ____________hospital.
VO: What did you do since?
(I talked about my jobs since graduating. My intern year and then of course my current job.)
VO: Whos sponsoring you?
Me: My uncle and aunt and a Dean’s scholarship.
(I told her the names of my sponsors, and how the scholarship was merit based.)
VO: What do they do?
(I told her each of their job titles and place of work)
VO: (Again confirmed my uncle’s workplace).
Me: Yes.
(She was typing a lot and looking at something on her screen while I talked about my sponsors)
VO: Do you have any financial documents of your uncle and aunt. Anything I can see now?
Me: Yes, I have their bank statements and affidavit of financial support. Would that be fine?
VO: Yes.
Me: Sorry they have these post-it/tags on them
VO: That’s fine.
Me: Okay here you go. (I also ended up giving both their passport copies)
VO: Oh so theyre separate people, not married to each other?
Me: Oh no no, theyre both separate people, not related.
VO: Where do they live?
Me: My uncle lives here in (my city) at ____ and my aunt lives in ____ (abroad, not US)
VO: (She sifted through everything; the bank statements, my I20, and was carefully reading even the affidavit. I should highlight here that I assume my last two rejections for the B1/B2 visa were because of my finances, which is probably why she was carefully reading everything in my case. Just my opinion.)
VO: Alright I see you have enough for one academic year. What about your second year?
Me: Yes, I have the Dean’s scholarship well into my second year as well, and my uncle and aunt will continue to support me.
VO: Okay.
(Then she was reading through something on the screen. She was doing this a lot during my interview and overall for others too maybe, cause other people were standing idly by her counter as well for a while.)
VO: I see you have previous rejections, was that trip for the USMLE? (many interviewees that day were going for their USMLE Step 3 or clinical rotations, just btw)
Me: Um, not exactly. I was also going for my clinical electives at ______ (this is a top ranked university in the US) where I had the chance to work with Dr ____ and another clinical elective at ______ (a famous research hospital in the US) to work with Dr ____. (I was excitedly telling her about the Drs because I genuinely find them both to be amazing)
VO: Are you not giving USMLE now?
Me: No. As I said, I am not pursuing a clinical career anymore. Im pursuing research.
VO: (I don’t recall the exact question. She asked me to elaborate on my career change. Like why I wasn’t practicing as a medical doctor and why I’m currently pursuing this degree and research?)
(I told her about when I switched and what led me to change my career to research. I just answered honestly.)
VO: How have your circumstances changed since then?
(I got confused because I thought I already elaborated on my career change so I mentioned it again and how this is for a masters degree.)
VO: No, what has changed? Did your sponsors not fund your trip last time?
Me: Oh no, my aunt and uncle weren’t my sponsors then. It was my father. He was sponsoring my trip last time.
VO: What do your parents do?
VO: How come your aunt and uncle are sponsoring you this time? How did that happen? (again, I don’t remember her exact words but she wanted me to elaborate why I made this change and how my aunt and uncle came to be my sponsors this time)
(I explained how they became my sponsors. They have been supportive of me throughout my application cycle and offered to fund my education. And I accepted.)
VO: Okay.
(Then she kept reading something. Kept scanning my passport. Was mostly looking at her screen during my interview. This felt like forever.)
VO: Alright, everything looks okay.
(Now this I was unprepared for, what should I say now lol. Should I say thanks or okay? So I just kept quiet lol)
VO: Im approving your visa! (Then she went on to explain how I will get my passport in 3-5 days, that she will keep my passport but return my I20 and SEVIS page. How I should keep this safe and make sure to bring it with me while travelling for the US Port of Entry I guess. I was in sheer shock so I was just blankly staring)
Me: Thank you! Thank you, hope you have a wonderful day ahead!
Took my documents and my folder and just rushed out.
The interview was longggg, as you can read. My VO was taking long interviews of nearly everyone I could see in that counter but it was not necessarily a bad thing. A lot of them were approved; you just had to be concise in your answers. The length itself can be intimidating, but if you’re honest and you’ve done your homework it will go well inshaAllah.
My brothers were a great source of help for me. They conducted my mock interviews and helped me throughout. One of my brothers is on an F1 visa in the US and I mentioned it in the DS160 form as well. But as you can read, she asked me nothing about that. I even mentioned an uncle in the US in my previous DS160 form for my B1/B2 applications, but she asked nothing about that either.
I reached out to many Pakistani students in the US through friends and friends of friends who all told me about their visa experiences and how it’s so straightforward and nothing to worry about. They were all super supportive and encouraging as well.
I used this group and the F1 visa experiences group on facebook a lot to gauge the kind of questions I could be asked and to learn from other people’s experiences. I made it a point to read mostly the approved posts. The rejected posts, though a lot more in number, serve to discourage and demotivate you. But yes, you can also learn from them. I still suggest reading mostly the approved posts. I even reached out to 
Rana Ibrar
 who was so gracious with his time and advice and guided me. He conducted a mock interview, told me about all possible questions, and was overall very motivating. He basically said: Your visa is approved! Long before I heard it in the consulate lol. JazakAllah Abrar!
Good luck to everyone applying. The 3Cs mentioned in this group’s featured post is spot on, and you will find anyone on the internet saying the same. Your finances, credibility as a student, and your commitment to the course and country and laws is what’s important. Which they will gauge from your interview mostly. If you are a genuine student and your finances are in order you should have no problem getting that visa inshaAllah.

Application date: 4th october 2022
Appointment date: 24th october 2022
Visa issued: 25th october 2022
Embassy location: Karachi
Visa status: Approved on 1st attempt alhamdulillah(Arrived in USA on 28th December 2022)
Interviewer was a short haired blondie on counter 3
***PS. The interview was long as I tried to drag it as much as possible, so I will try to write as much as I can remember bear with the long post I hope it can be helpful***
Me: Hello
VO: Hey, how are you?
Me: I am good, I hope you are doing well too.
VO: thank you, May I have your picture
Me: Sure, here you go?
VO: How much time has passed since you got this captured?
Me: Maybe 2 months or a little over I don’t remember exactly.
VO: Is your picture edited?
Me: Oh yes, I guess it is as I got it taken at a studio
VO: Alright, may I have your documents please?
Me: You mean the bundle they made at first security check?
VO: Yeah that’s the one
Me: Here you go!
VO: Thank you (takes a glance at my documents and started typing away on her computer vigorously)
Me: Pleasure is all mine!
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going for higher studies, masters in civil engineering precisely.
VO: (continues typing while asking) Which university did you applied to?
Me: Oh I applied to 4 universities and got accepted at Lamar university
VO: Where else did you applied to?
Me: I applied at 3 other universities *told the names*, I originally planned to go for bridgeford but the communication with them was not so efficient and Lamar had swift responses so I thought why not!
VO: Can you tell me about your bachelors course?
Me: You mean the whole curriculum or the background of what it was about?
VO: Yeah the background (still focusing on her computer)
***BTW a handful tip try to get the interviewers’ attention because that is actually an indication that she is interested in knowing about you and most likely to grant you a visa so stop making robotic internet responses come up with your own originality***
Me: I explained about my bachelors and research major
VO: Ok so who is funding your studies?
Me: Well ofcorse my father is funding my studies as I am a student and I don’t work plus I also was able to get scholarship on merit basis
VO: What does your father do?
Me: He is a businessman
VO: What kind of business he runs?
Me: Oh he rents out heavy machineries for road carpet finish and supplies bitumen.
VO: Sorry, what bitumen?
Me: Uh you know the finish product of the road, small black rocks used for carpeting the roads.
VO: Oh yeah I got that, so why did you chose civil engineering for masters?
(She was continuously typing at this point too and I was trying to drag the convo as much as I can so she can start talking to me actually face to face)
Me: Ok so the story goes way long back, my father supported and encouraged me a lot regarding my education and such as I have no brother he placed all his expectations on me in this regard and trained me for such so that when I grow up I can help him with the business handling and that’s the reason it became my passion to actually learn about what my father does and to help him improve I wanted to learn about it from a worldly aspect so that we can adapt the technology and methods used around the world.
VO: Oh wow that’s cool!
(She glanced at me and started typing away again and I stood there waiting but seconds felt like hours and it felt like the pause was too long so I started talking again)
Me: While doing my thesis I got lucky and my bachelors research preprint got published too which was a milestone for me.
VO: (finally she leave her computer leaned on the table and turned her whole attention towards me and that felt like an achievement at that moment TBH) Tell me more about it.
Me: So my research was about the airport management at Karachi Jinnah Intl Airport and its aspects.
VO: How is airport management related to what you want to study?
Me: Yeah the infrastructure and management aspect you know.
VO: Ohhh now that’s cool, Congratulations your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you!
***She was giving me the yellow approval slip alongwith my documents bundle from the small window and suddenly stopped either ends of the documents in each of our hands***
VO: When does your classes start?
Me: Oh they start from 17th Jan 2023.
VO: Alright you are free to go
(I took the document and went straight outside without seeing back and out where I cam from in)
***Remember you can be nervous it doesn’t matters because the officers are well aware of that no matter how hard you try to hide it it’s just going to get worse so do not bother with that but don’t lose your composure in the process this is the thing you need to work on. Never ever express your gratitudes and emotions and joyness when your visa gets approved as it is going to convey that you are desperate and most highly chance of getting rejected because they can do it that is what they are checking from the very beginning till the end, they are not interested in you because of all those robotic answers they hear all day long so make them actually talk to you, and last but not the least recite some duas for ease all the time on the way to the embassy till you stand in front of the interviewer, don’t think about acception or rejection that’s the main thing and you will automatically start to talk without any hesitation***
That’s all for now if you have any further questions feel free to ring my inbox and best of luck for thise who have upcoming interviews believe in Allah have faith in yourself and ace the interview afterall you are paying a hefty amount just to get to talk with the person and still you have to be nervous from thise who are taking your money, give yourself a prep talk and you are good to go.
Best Regards

Interview experience. F1 visa. Karachi Embassy.
Alhamdulillah got my visa approved.
They only asked for my DS 160 confirmation,SEVIS, I20 and most recent passport at the entrance. Visa officer also checked only these. Didn't ask for anything else.
VO: 
Morning
Me: Morning
Then he asked for the finger-scanning. I did it. Then he asked the first question.
Why MBA?
I was about to answer and he interrupted, ""something went wrong with prints, we will have to repeat.""
This did throw me a bit as it disrupted my thoughts flow. But I scanned my fingers again and then he repeated same question.
VO: Why MBA?
Me: I answered, it was based on personal details.
VO: Why this university?
Me: Multiple reasons. It has really good marketing program, something I am interested in majoring. It also has a cool academies program. Where students get one to one mentorship and get to work on real life business cases. Also it's somewhere I have previously attended a summer exchange program at 6 years ago. And finally, they give a really good financial aid package.
VO: (Looked at my I20). So who is paying for it?
Me: Like I said I have really good financial aid package. And for the rest I have taken out a student loan.
VO: Did you get the loan from Pakistan?
Me: No, prodigy finance.
VO: Based on what information did they approve your loan?
Me: Oh just my employment history, bank history and credit score.
VO: Do you have friends or family in USA?
Me: No, first one from my family to be going there.
VO: That's nice.
Then he typed for like a full minute or 2 which felt like ages and then said, congratulations, your visa has been approved. You will get an email when your passport is ready to be collected.
He also handed me a yellow slip saying my visa is approved and how will I collect it.
PS:. From what I read here, I thought yellow was administrative processing and blue was approval. But approval is yellow.
