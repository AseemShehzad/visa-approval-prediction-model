1st Attempt: Approved Alhumdulillah.
Interview was at 25th May Karachi Consulate.
Profile: BS from LUMS, going for MS Finance at University of Houston. Had Received out-of-station tuition waiver and additional scholarship as well. Have been working at Multinational bank for almost two years now.
VO: 
Pass me your passport and F1.
VO:  Why university of Houston?
ME: Firstly, the courses which they are offering, related to derivates trading and hedging and this is where my professional experience lies, as I have been working in the banking industry for over 2 years now, and I feel this degree would help me fill in the gaps in my skill set.
Also, one of my university professors had recommended this course and degree, as he had also completed his master’s from there.
Also, I have been following Professor XYZ, throughout my undergraduate phase, and read his publications on hedging techniques, so I thought it would be quite an experience to take live lectures from him.
VO: interesting!
VO: What is your job ?
ME: Told him about the general job description, routine tasks etc.
VO: Plans after graduation.
ME: Obviously, the plan is to complete my master’s with good GPA. And then to focus on my banking career, as employers in the Pakistani banking sectors tend to value those profiles and individuals who have done their education specifically from US Colleges. In fact, my current supervisor had done his Master’s from abroad, and at a very young age he is doing quite well. I have a similar objective, I believe this degree would help me to excel in the Pakistan banking sector, also that I have made good repo with my supervisor, he would be willing to hire me at a senior position, once I complete my master’s.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME:  it is my father.
VO: What is his profession?
ME: He is a banker as well, and currently working in one of the banks in UAE.
VO: Pass me the statement.
I handed over the statement to him.
VO: Your credentials are good, I am approving your visa. You will get your passport in a week.
For all the aspirants out here, the only thing matters is your level of confidence and communication skills. Regardless of the circumstances, and whatever is the outcome, just give your 100% and maintain eye-contact.

( For most of the time, she kept looking and typing at the screen. Didn't look at me for longer than a second or two during each of my answers. Also my answers were brief and to the point so she didn't have to look for long either.
I kept an eye contact during the whole interview and also maintained a bit smile throughout my interview though it went quite long and I had to wait a lot in between too.
I had a plus point of already having a visit visa so I used that in start while answering the question of why I chose that uni. As I heard that the VO may have not gone through all your data so you should convey them such info yourself.
Though my answers were not in detail but i did prepare myself for any type of detail. I made a list of all possible questions and prepared the detailed answers then filtered out the important information only.  Saved the detail for only the case if they themselves ask me to go into.
You should definitely have all the information about the university you're applying to. They should not get the idea that you've selected a university without doing any proper research)

I also told him about breakup of my scholarship like amount to stipend , fees wavier and health insurance even he was holding my offer letter in hand. 
Vo: he wrote everything and then again asked me is it HEC Scholarship 
Me: no it’s not HEC Scholarship. It’s from university and professor. 
Vo : said ok . Wait infront of the counter where u were interviewed by the lady .
Me : I came out of room and kept waiting in front of counter.
After 15 mins gap I was called by the foreigner lady to come on counter and I moved to the counter 
Vo: she said me to tell about the program you are going
And what would be your major 
Me : I m going for Phd Environmental science and would be working waste to energy and so on 
Vo : started typing and handed over me the extra document that Pakistan Man(visa interview) took from me.
Me: I said thank you and was taking deep breath and was feeling happy because she didn’t returned me the passport. 
Vo: Stoped typing and said your passport will be with us and congratulations your visa is approved and handed over me the blue slip and said you will get your passport soon. 
Me : I said thank you and left the counter and left consulate as 2nd last person. 
On the other hand my family was upset as my visa status was like refused but when I came out and told them my visa is approved they were in shock . 
With this interview I would say always stick on ur answer and try to complete your all forms like DS-160 your self . 
Best wishes for everyone and keep firm belief on yourself and your struggles — 
feeling blessed.

Please approve. As this was approved earlier but the topic of degree was diff.
 Thank you.
Assalam-u-Alaikum 
Greetings Everyone. 
Any 
kind of help would be truly appreciated.
Profile:- 
1) 2.59 GPA Reason for low is that I never knew min 3 will be required and no one was there to guide . 
2) Took IELTS academic back in 2020 scored 7.0 overall
3) More than 5 + years of experience in relevant field in top tier organisations locally and international. After this extensive period in the industry, I want to pursue masters as It would open doors for me in my professional growth. 
4) Undergrad Major = Computer science 
5) certification = data analytics , digital marketing , sql and other related 
Can somebody please guide me of the universities that I eligible for, I have a list of universities that are accepting 2.5 -2.7GPA but when i went to some of the university websites, they are preferring more than the mentioned. 
I also have an offer letter of Western New England and Mercy college NY but the course fee of thee ranges 3500-3800$. So it will be really hard for me to earn this much of amount. 
Also my budget is in the range of 25-30 lac for the first semester. And after that need to earn it on my own.
Can someone help me in find the university where I can pay my fee and can help me get a visa in the discipline of data analytics, business analytics, big data, data science or realted ones ?
Also are there any members who had a similar case like mine and that they were able to succeed in this journey. 
Thank you so much in advance for the help. JazakAllah o khair

These questions are so simple but in a way its more difficult for those students who are feeling hesitation in front of visa officer.
So the thing all students have to do is Just be confident and look in the eyes of the visa officer. Don’t lie about anything, they already have your background data and talk to them what they ask in simple words. 
Again i want to say that its not dependent on the University u graduated or have been to any country. Main thing is confidence
Special thanks to sir junaid, group admin and all members who are helping everyone.

VISA EXPERIENCE 
VISA APPROVED,ALLHAMDULLILAH
21July'22 9:00am ( hardly 5 mints interview)
Visa officer -chinese looking guy( Karachi embassy)
Vo : good morning 
Me: 
hello good morning Vo
Vo: please put your fingers on scanner, pressed tightly the pinky finger ( in a laughing way)
Me: does as told
Vo: oh I see you are working in a bank?
Me: yes I work in a local bank of Pakistan as Trainer / quality assurance executive in customer satisfaction and quality department. I train freshly hired officer (said a bit proudly:p)
Vo: why are you going to USA?
Me: i am going to USA for pursuing my MBA in marketing from New Mexico Highland University,  lasvegas 
Vo: How did you get to know about this university?
Me: my previous university professor recommended me this uni as he was an alumni of nmhu. Beside this I searched this university through different website like us news, niche and master portal.
Vo: you have such a stable job, why you want to leave it ?
Me: after becoming Trainer I didn't thought to go for masters degree because I was already achieving my goals step by step. But recently I got rejected for a managerial post in my company with a reason that I am not holding a masters degree and( as this was eligibility criteria for managerial post) this thing hit me harder and then I decided to apply for Mba. ( tbh it's a true story)
Vo: oh i see, after looking at my I 20 meticulously he said, oh who is xyz( my sponsor's name)
Me: he is my uncle who live in USA and is a US citizen 
Vo: what he do for living?
Me: He owns an It company named as xyz. This company is in over 240+ location but he owns the Santonio location.
Vo: will you ask you employer for leaves or you will resign ?
Me: I have discussed this with my head of department, they are talking with HR let's see what they will suggest. You know every firm has it on policy. Even if the don't approve my sabbatical leaves I'll resign and rejoin after completing my MBA. I know I  will get the job with my acquaintance and credibility 
Vo: congratulations you VISA is approved. 
*Posting this for encouraging all those people who are scared of several things. My case my pretty critical, chances of rejection was high because of primarily two reasons:
1. My brother lives in USA currently he recently got graduated from Louisiana state university and is in opt right now( vo didn't even asked about him)
2. Secondly my sponsor was my mother's cousin who is a US citizen.
But that's not a big thing if your are confident and sound genuine, means your story should sound real not made up. The most important thing is your  faith in Allah. If you say that I have strong faith but stillyou feel scared and week then your beliefs are not strong. I would like to thanks

  who helped me to articulate my answers , encouraged and motivated me for acing this interview. I couldn't achieved this without his help.

***APPROVED***
LOCATION KARACHI
TIME SLOT 8.30
BUSINESS ANALYTICS (MS)
INTERVIEWER: INFAMOUS ASIAN
NO GRE
NO IELTS
GPA 2.86
Date: 8th June.
DISCLAIMER: My interview was very different from others so please don't take it as a guide as I don't want to mislead anyone.
After preparing myself for straight 20 days I went for an Interview, I was prepared for every kind of question, but there was something else written in my fate.
VO DID NOT ASK ANY COMMON QUESTIONS LIKE:
Why US? 
Why this university?
Rather he started like this
1) what are your daily responsibilities in your current job?
2) what does your father do? (Convinced with my one word ANSWER)
3) what are your plans after graduation? (Told him the names of 3 it companies name where I'm aiming to work at)
4) do you have any relatives? I said yes because I didn't want to lie
5) will you leave the current job? I said yes (btw I just joined that job 20 days ago)
Conclusion: All that time he was behaving as if the decision is already decided because he seemed too uninterested to hear my answers. It was like as if he was just completing a formality nothing else.
In a nutshell, for me US F1 VISA IS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON LUCK BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A HEC FUNDED PHD LEVEL GUY GETTING REJECTED WHOSE PROFILE WAS 4X STRONGER THAN MINE.
BUT GO WELL PREPARED AND BE CONFIDENT. I ALSO GREETED HIM IN A VERY LOUD VOICE. Also don't forget to pray and take your mother's prayers as they can do wonders.
GOODLUCK!
Thankyou 
Rana Ibrar

I was a bit nervous and none of my answers went 100% smooth.
Here's how interview went.
VO: Hello(in very friendly tone)
Me: Hi
VO: (After taking my docs and entering them on PC) Why are you going to US?
Me: I am going to attend Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Cincinnati.
VO: (After a pause) Why did you choose this University?
Me: (I stuttered during this answer a bit) I am going because this university is aligned with my research interest.
VO: Why did you choose University of Cincinnati specifically?
Me: Because the lab facilities and faculty is suited to my research in additive manufacturing. It's the same research that I did in my bachelor's. (stuttered here too)
VO: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father. (I stopped after saying this for around 20 secs and then started speaking again) He is manager at X and makes Y money through job Z money through rentals and some money thru real estate trading which I don't know how much is.
VO: Cograts. Enjoy your stay at united states.
Me: Thanks.
Thoughts? 
The visa doesn't mostly depend on the interview. The VO wasn't even listening to me with attention. It depends on your uni, course and any funding you have(I had $20k scholarship). My interview wasn't the best. Actually, I would say it was average or below average.
Almost all visas(5/5) got approved before me. Only 2 were refused, who went after me. Those 2 had genuine reasons to refuse. If I were VO, I would even refuse them(not cuz of hate lol but their case didn't seem strong on paper)
Suggestions?
1. Don't go for consultants. They apply for you at few unis which VOs are aware of. VOs don't even consider you in that case. They straight away reject you.
2. Take IELTS. Take GRE. Secure full/partial scholarship(you can easily get it). Then go for visa. You will get it InshAllah.

ADMIN URGENT APPROVAL, SINCE I ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL HELPFUL INFO. 
By the grace of Almighty Allah Visa Status: Approved
Type: F1
Time and date: 8:45 am, 22nd May 2023
Embassy: Karachi
VO: An American lady
VO: Good Morning
Me: Good Morning. How are you, ma'am?
VO: Fine, thank you! 
VO: So, why are you going to Georgia State University.
Me: To pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science
VO: Who will sponsor your studies?
Me: Told
VO: What does he do?
Me: Told
VO: Show me your sponsor's statement of account:
Me: Handed it over.
VO: Have you previously applied for a US visa? (looking at my previous record)
Me: No (My parents applied for a US visit a few years ago when I was not old enough to know what was going on, so I couldn't recall it the first time she asked about it).
VO: Are you sure? (Looks at me sideways)
Me: (Then it finally occurred to me that, yeah, my parents had applied for a visa back in the day. I clarified that I was young, so that's why I couldn't recall it. VO laughs it off)
VO: Okay, then, I am approving your visa, and make sure to collect your passport in 2 to 3 days.
Me: Was overwhelmed with emotions and in utter disbelief.
My take: The interview itself lasted hardly 45 seconds. I would say that my sponsor (I'd mind disclosing my sponsor) was the sole reason for my approval. The VO did not ask any other major or college-related questions apart from what was asked above. Also, given my interview experience and what was happening inside the interview room, VOs do not reject you out of rudeness or some other baseless reason. Neither you have met the interviewers nor the interviews have met you. It all comes down to how you present yourself and how genuine of a student you are. Anyway, enough of my Ted talk. 
Thank you, Almighty Allah, my parents, and the countless members of Pakistani Student in USA, who were willing to share their interview experiences regardless of their outcome.
Thank you once again!
Edit:
An important thing I did not mention: I qualified for an out-of-state waiver at the college. Essentially, I've been waived off out-of-state tuition and will pay in-state tuition, tuition paid by a Georgian resident that is far cheaper than out-of-state tuition.
So, for those looking to apply to GSU, the university will automatically consider your application for this waiver, and you have better chances to qualify for one if you submit your apps in early September or as soon as applications open.
The waiver goes by the name of Campus Atlanta Scholarship, which
includes either a 50% or a 100% waiver.

Background info: I had two prior B1/B2 rejections 3-4 years ago.

VO: Please pass your documents. (She spent a lot of time looking at her screen and my I20.)
VO: Why the US?
(I feel like I fumbled here but I just answered how the US is the best at research and my program and that’s why I want to pursue my masters there at (my uni))
VO: Why (this uni)? (it’s in the top 20 of my grad program, btw)
(I gave my reasons and I also mentioned that I talked to current students and alumni.)
VO: How many people did you talk to?
(I told her about the students I talked to and the staff at uni I talked to, as well as the information seminars I attended.)
VO: Why this course?
(I talked about my major, its application in research, and how im interested in pursuing a career in this field.)
VO: What kind of research?
(I told her the kind of diseases im interested in studying.)
VO: What diseases specifically?
(I told her about the two diseases im interested in researching that are also prevalent in my community.)
[P.S: I had experience managing these diseases as a doctor.]
VO: Where do you work currently?
(I told her my job title in clinical research and my work place)
VO: What do you do in your job exactly?
(I elaborated on my duties in my current job.)
VO: How will this course help you? What kind of career can you have?
(I elaborated on how research is something ive already been involved in since my undergrad years and im continuing that. And I told her the several different jobs I can get here in Pakistan. And how it’s a step up from my current work and job title.)
VO: Where would you find these jobs here (in Pakistan)?
(I told her about the place I want to work at in my city and the person there im interested in working with. I also mentioned my current workplace.)
VO: So you’re a medical doctor?
Me: Yes
VO: When did you graduate?
Me: three years ago
VO: Where did you graduate from?
(I told her my university name.)
VO: Where is this college?
Me: Here in ___ (my city) right next to the ____________hospital.
VO: What did you do since?
(I talked about my jobs since graduating. My intern year and then of course my current job.)
VO: Whos sponsoring you?
Me: My uncle and aunt and a Dean’s scholarship.
(I told her the names of my sponsors, and how the scholarship was merit based.)
VO: What do they do?
(I told her each of their job titles and place of work)
VO: (Again confirmed my uncle’s workplace).
Me: Yes.
(She was typing a lot and looking at something on her screen while I talked about my sponsors)
VO: Do you have any financial documents of your uncle and aunt. Anything I can see now?
Me: Yes, I have their bank statements and affidavit of financial support. Would that be fine?
VO: Yes.
Me: Sorry they have these post-it/tags on them
VO: That’s fine.
Me: Okay here you go. (I also ended up giving both their passport copies)
VO: Oh so theyre separate people, not married to each other?
Me: Oh no no, theyre both separate people, not related.
VO: Where do they live?
Me: My uncle lives here in (my city) at ____ and my aunt lives in ____ (abroad, not US)
VO: (She sifted through everything; the bank statements, my I20, and was carefully reading even the affidavit. I should highlight here that I assume my last two rejections for the B1/B2 visa were because of my finances, which is probably why she was carefully reading everything in my case. Just my opinion.)
VO: Alright I see you have enough for one academic year. What about your second year?
Me: Yes, I have the Dean’s scholarship well into my second year as well, and my uncle and aunt will continue to support me.
VO: Okay.
(Then she was reading through something on the screen. She was doing this a lot during my interview and overall for others too maybe, cause other people were standing idly by her counter as well for a while.)
VO: I see you have previous rejections, was that trip for the USMLE? (many interviewees that day were going for their USMLE Step 3 or clinical rotations, just btw)
Me: Um, not exactly. I was also going for my clinical electives at ______ (this is a top ranked university in the US) where I had the chance to work with Dr ____ and another clinical elective at ______ (a famous research hospital in the US) to work with Dr ____. (I was excitedly telling her about the Drs because I genuinely find them both to be amazing)
VO: Are you not giving USMLE now?
Me: No. As I said, I am not pursuing a clinical career anymore. Im pursuing research.
VO: (I don’t recall the exact question. She asked me to elaborate on my career change. Like why I wasn’t practicing as a medical doctor and why I’m currently pursuing this degree and research?)
(I told her about when I switched and what led me to change my career to research. I just answered honestly.)
VO: How have your circumstances changed since then?
(I got confused because I thought I already elaborated on my career change so I mentioned it again and how this is for a masters degree.)
VO: No, what has changed? Did your sponsors not fund your trip last time?
Me: Oh no, my aunt and uncle weren’t my sponsors then. It was my father. He was sponsoring my trip last time.
VO: What do your parents do?
VO: How come your aunt and uncle are sponsoring you this time? How did that happen? (again, I don’t remember her exact words but she wanted me to elaborate why I made this change and how my aunt and uncle came to be my sponsors this time)
(I explained how they became my sponsors. They have been supportive of me throughout my application cycle and offered to fund my education. And I accepted.)
VO: Okay.
(Then she kept reading something. Kept scanning my passport. Was mostly looking at her screen during my interview. This felt like forever.)
VO: Alright, everything looks okay.
(Now this I was unprepared for, what should I say now lol. Should I say thanks or okay? So I just kept quiet lol)
VO: Im approving your visa! (Then she went on to explain how I will get my passport in 3-5 days, that she will keep my passport but return my I20 and SEVIS page. How I should keep this safe and make sure to bring it with me while travelling for the US Port of Entry I guess. I was in sheer shock so I was just blankly staring)
Me: Thank you! Thank you, hope you have a wonderful day ahead!
Took my documents and my folder and just rushed out.
The interview was longggg, as you can read. My VO was taking long interviews of nearly everyone I could see in that counter but it was not necessarily a bad thing. A lot of them were approved; you just had to be concise in your answers. The length itself can be intimidating, but if you’re honest and you’ve done your homework it will go well inshaAllah.
My brothers were a great source of help for me. They conducted my mock interviews and helped me throughout. One of my brothers is on an F1 visa in the US and I mentioned it in the DS160 form as well. But as you can read, she asked me nothing about that. I even mentioned an uncle in the US in my previous DS160 form for my B1/B2 applications, but she asked nothing about that either.
I reached out to many Pakistani students in the US through friends and friends of friends who all told me about their visa experiences and how it’s so straightforward and nothing to worry about. They were all super supportive and encouraging as well.
I used this group and the F1 visa experiences group on facebook a lot to gauge the kind of questions I could be asked and to learn from other people’s experiences. I made it a point to read mostly the approved posts. The rejected posts, though a lot more in number, serve to discourage and demotivate you. But yes, you can also learn from them. I still suggest reading mostly the approved posts. I even reached out to 
Rana Ibrar
 who was so gracious with his time and advice and guided me. He conducted a mock interview, told me about all possible questions, and was overall very motivating. He basically said: Your visa is approved! Long before I heard it in the consulate lol. JazakAllah Abrar!
Good luck to everyone applying. The 3Cs mentioned in this group’s featured post is spot on, and you will find anyone on the internet saying the same. Your finances, credibility as a student, and your commitment to the course and country and laws is what’s important. Which they will gauge from your interview mostly. If you are a genuine student and your finances are in order you should have no problem getting that visa inshaAllah.

University: University of California, Davis
Program: PhD Computer Science (fully funded)
Location: Islamabad Embassy
Status: Approved and Issued
Interview: 12th June
Interview was scheduled at 9 00 but took place around 12 pm. 
VO asked me the following questions:
1- Which university are you going to?
University of California, Davis
2- Why this university? 
There are multiple reasons
A) Its a very good research school.
B) I have worked with a professor there for my honor's thesis and I really enjoyed the work and it will allow me to continue working with them.
C) They also offered me a fellowship. 
3- what will you be researching on?
I will be working in program analysis mainly software testing. We will be making open source tools to automate the testing for critical softwares such as browsers and operating system kernels.
4 - Her expression changed upon hearing the word automate, and she stopped typing and said , by automate you mean like AI? 
No, we will be doing it through graphs and different tools, we will be mainly working on rust (a new programming language). (She didn't understand the technical terms but said ohh okay).
{I also had my advisor wrote me a letter stating the research I will be doing , so I told her I also have a letter from my supervisor which states my research, but she said I don't need it).
5- where did you do your undergrad from?
Lahore university of management sciences.
6- do you have a masters degree?
No, I am going after my undergrad, it's a masters leading to a PhD program.
7- what does your father do.
Told he is retired. (I expected the next answer would be about expenses , so I told her my program is fully funded and here's the funding letter - I tried passing her the letter to which she said, yes, I can see that on your I 20.)
8- what are your future plans?
I plan to work in academia. I would like to come back to Pakistan and join my undergrad institute as an Associate professor, a PhD is a a minimum requirement for that - I really enjoy teaching and I worked as teaching assistant for 5 courses during my undergrad - pointed towards my resume as well.
VO started typing and scrolling for like a minute.
9- Do you have any relatives in the US?
No.
She scrolled and type for like 30ish seconds and passed me the blue slip.
Just keep it simple, and causal. Be confident. Take it as a conversation not an interview. Be yourself. 
Best of luck, you got this.

Congrats, I am approving your visa! 
I was shocked at what is happening...
VO already rejected 4 students in front of me after a full detailed interview..
And I want to tell you one thing interesting ... I was in the line where VO was a lady and she was rejecting everyone and rejecting 4,5 students already...When she calls me for an interview I skipped the line...Their security officer asked me why I skip the line?. I said I feel hesitant in front of the lady officer 
...He said okayy and allow me to give my interview to the male Visa officer..
It was quick barely 2 minutes. I was prepared and confident enough. 
Serious suggestion:- Be confident with a smiling face and don't hesitate... VO wants to give VISA if you are confident...
Thanks...

Interviewer was a short haired blondie on counter 3
***PS. The interview was long as I tried to drag it as much as possible, so I will try to write as much as I can remember bear with the long post I hope it can be helpful***
Me: Hello
VO: Hey, how are you?
Me: I am good, I hope you are doing well too.
VO: thank you, May I have your picture
Me: Sure, here you go?
VO: How much time has passed since you got this captured?
Me: Maybe 2 months or a little over I don’t remember exactly.
VO: Is your picture edited?
Me: Oh yes, I guess it is as I got it taken at a studio
VO: Alright, may I have your documents please?
Me: You mean the bundle they made at first security check?
VO: Yeah that’s the one
Me: Here you go!
VO: Thank you (takes a glance at my documents and started typing away on her computer vigorously)
Me: Pleasure is all mine!
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going for higher studies, masters in civil engineering precisely.
VO: (continues typing while asking) Which university did you applied to?
Me: Oh I applied to 4 universities and got accepted at Lamar university
VO: Where else did you applied to?
Me: I applied at 3 other universities *told the names*, I originally planned to go for bridgeford but the communication with them was not so efficient and Lamar had swift responses so I thought why not!
VO: Can you tell me about your bachelors course?
Me: You mean the whole curriculum or the background of what it was about?
VO: Yeah the background (still focusing on her computer)
***BTW a handful tip try to get the interviewers’ attention because that is actually an indication that she is interested in knowing about you and most likely to grant you a visa so stop making robotic internet responses come up with your own originality***
Me: I explained about my bachelors and research major
VO: Ok so who is funding your studies?
Me: Well ofcorse my father is funding my studies as I am a student and I don’t work plus I also was able to get scholarship on merit basis
VO: What does your father do?
Me: He is a businessman
VO: What kind of business he runs?
Me: Oh he rents out heavy machineries for road carpet finish and supplies bitumen.
VO: Sorry, what bitumen?
Me: Uh you know the finish product of the road, small black rocks used for carpeting the roads.
VO: Oh yeah I got that, so why did you chose civil engineering for masters?
(She was continuously typing at this point too and I was trying to drag the convo as much as I can so she can start talking to me actually face to face)
Me: Ok so the story goes way long back, my father supported and encouraged me a lot regarding my education and such as I have no brother he placed all his expectations on me in this regard and trained me for such so that when I grow up I can help him with the business handling and that’s the reason it became my passion to actually learn about what my father does and to help him improve I wanted to learn about it from a worldly aspect so that we can adapt the technology and methods used around the world.
VO: Oh wow that’s cool!
(She glanced at me and started typing away again and I stood there waiting but seconds felt like hours and it felt like the pause was too long so I started talking again)
Me: While doing my thesis I got lucky and my bachelors research preprint got published too which was a milestone for me.
VO: (finally she leave her computer leaned on the table and turned her whole attention towards me and that felt like an achievement at that moment TBH) Tell me more about it.
Me: So my research was about the airport management at Karachi Jinnah Intl Airport and its aspects.
VO: How is airport management related to what you want to study?
Me: Yeah the infrastructure and management aspect you know.
VO: Ohhh now that’s cool, Congratulations your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you!
***She was giving me the yellow approval slip alongwith my documents bundle from the small window and suddenly stopped either ends of the documents in each of our hands***
VO: When does your classes start?
Me: Oh they start from 17th Jan 2023.
VO: Alright you are free to go
(I took the document and went straight outside without seeing back and out where I cam from in)
***Remember you can be nervous it doesn’t matters because the officers are well aware of that no matter how hard you try to hide it it’s just going to get worse so do not bother with that but don’t lose your composure in the process this is the thing you need to work on. Never ever express your gratitudes and emotions and joyness when your visa gets approved as it is going to convey that you are desperate and most highly chance of getting rejected because they can do it that is what they are checking from the very beginning till the end, they are not interested in you because of all those robotic answers they hear all day long so make them actually talk to you, and last but not the least recite some duas for ease all the time on the way to the embassy till you stand in front of the interviewer, don’t think about acception or rejection that’s the main thing and you will automatically start to talk without any hesitation***
That’s all for now if you have any further questions feel free to ring my inbox and best of luck for thise who have upcoming interviews believe in Allah have faith in yourself and ace the interview afterall you are paying a hefty amount just to get to talk with the person and still you have to be nervous from thise who are taking your money, give yourself a prep talk and you are good to go.
Best Regards

returned my greetings.

Me:- So Sir, my school has a very comprehensive College Counselling program, I came to know about Union College through my college Counsellor and I applied to 10 Unis and got admission into 7 of those with varying degree of Scholarships .

VO:- Is it a big restaurant? 
Me:- Yes . 
(Big mistake) 
VO:- Whats the name of his restaurant? 
Me:- Tells the name.
(VO searches for the restaurant on google and is unable to find it because the name on the income statements and the actual name were different and I told him the name as per income statement) 
VO:- Your fathers business is not showing up . 
( Gives a very scary look) 
Me:- Try *tells the real name*, you would be able to see my father and a couple of reviews. 
( i said something about the name being changed recently or because of the language thingy, I just spewed words I could think of ) 
VO:- What would you do after your studies?

2:- Go early, my interview was at 9 30 and I went in at 9 o clock and got into the embassy at 12. 
3:- Get atleast 2 copies of Confirmation letter and your Id card because they take those  before the shuttle service. And if you don’t have these you need to get into the line for photocopy and thats an additional 30 minutes. 
4:- The only options for the shuttle service was 3000 and 5000, and the lady said that I needed to take the premium service because I was getting late.
They try to sell the premium service but it not necessary at all because there is another line outside the embassy. 
5:- Don’t worry about the time , My appointment was scheduled for 9 30 and I was interviewed at 12 15 . 
6:- I had done a mock interview with my college counselor and read a couple of interviews in the group . I read the frequently asked questions mentioned in the post of a Mod. 
Allah Khair krsi.
I’m not an expert but if anybody needs any kind of help feel free to ask .

My sponsor is xyz and he has a business based in pakistan. (Gave some details of his business here to avoid usual follow up questions regarding sponsor. 
VO: Your visa is approved. 
The interview was of one minute at max. I had an upper hand because of being a issued a tourist visa earlier but most people were getting accepted that day. 
A few pointers for people who would be applying:
- Aim for universities that have a QS ranking of under 500. 
- Apply to multiple universities (3-5) as it shows the student's interest in studying. 
- Try applying to a field that is related to your current work experience or undergraduate degree. 
All they really see is the student's authenticity and his ability to come back after studies. If they have any doubt about the student staying there or going to earn money, they will reject your visa. 
All the best, may Allah make the process easy for everyone.

Bismillah, Alhamdulillah by the grace of Allah and prayers of my parents my visa has been approved.
Visa interview experiences
Here is the detailed post for all of my interview experiences from 2017 to 2021. 
It 
is going to be a long post so please bear the headache in your stomach while reading. However, I will try to make it short. 
So it all started when I completed my intermediate(HSSC) from Pakistan. I did my IELTS and applied through a consultant at Wichita state university. My score in IELTS was not that good also, I secured admission in a pathway program.  
1st interview experience.
Embassy: Islamabad
University: Wichita state university. 
Course: Pathway+ bachelors in Aerospace engineering. 
Date: I don't remember the exact date but I think it was on the 4th of Feb 2017. 
Vo: Good morning
Me: Good morning mam. How are u?
Vo: Give me ur documents
Me: Handed over my documents to her. 
Vo: Why are you going to us?
Me: I am going to pursue my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering.
Vo: Which uni?
Me: Wichita state uni
Vo: Why this uni?
Me: Told about uni curriculum, professor's research, etc.
Vo: How many unis u have applied to?
Me: 3 and named them.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: Father
Vo: What does your sponsor do?
Me: Told about my father's govt job and rental shops that we own.
Vo: Give me your bank statement?
Me: Gave her
Vo: Educational documents as well..
Me: I handed over all the documents to her. 
Vo took my passport i20 along with those documents which were asked ...
Ok, I am giving you this white sheet for processing ur documents..  means 221(g).
My case was transferred into the administration process where they verify documents I think. I was really happy as 90+% 221g cases are approved. When I left the embassy and check the online status, it was saying refused. I was stunned that how it could be possible that after one hour of my interview, they refused me. Anyhow, after a few days, I got an email to pick up your documents from .... location, I picked up my documents along with 214B sheet. It was really unfair to me as everything was genuine and still, they rejected me.. 
I thought to apply again as I wasn't aware of the reason for rejection. 
2nd interview experience.
Embassy: ISL
University: I applied with the same university and with the same course as it was in my first interview.

The Visa officer handed over me 214b and said I cannot approve your visa, I left the embassy without saying anything.

After getting 3 rejections, I thought to apply to more universities and I got accepted into 5-6 universities this time. I selected Indiana tech university as I was having a good amount of scholarships. 
4th attempt.
Embassy: ISL
University; Indiana institute of technology with $13000 scholarship.
Course: Bs mechanical engineering without any pathway.
Date: August 2017.
Intake: Fall.
VO: which uni? 
Me: Indiana tech.
Vo: Why you are going for engineering again?
Me: I said, I did intermediate here in Pak but not engineering. 
Vo: which program?
Me: bs mechanical eng.
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: My father is sponsoring me along with this I have secured a 13000$ scholarship from that uni,
Vo: what does your father do?
Me: Same answer. 
Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is written in this paper(214B).
After getting a rejection, I thought to apply again for the Spring intake. 
5th attempt.
Embassy: ISL.
University: Same as it was in 4th attempt.
Date: 31 November 2017
Intake: Spring.
Vo: Where are you going?
Me: Fort Wayne biggest city of Indiana state,
Vo: Can I explain the changes in my profile?
Vo: no thanks,
Vo: Who is sponsoring you?
Me: Father 
Vo: What does he do?
Me: same as I used to speak for my sponsor in previous interviews.
Vo: I cannot approve your visa. 
Me: Thanks.
It was my fifth attempt and had wasted almost two years for the same. I can apply for Australia or Uk at that time, my brain was saying to apply in other countries and my heart was like no no you should go to the USA as it has been my biggest wish to get a USA visa and study over there. 
Anyways, I decided to complete my bachelor's here in Pakistan and apply again for my master's study in the states. 
I completed my bachelor's degree in October 2020 with a 3.7 CGPA.
I took the Duolingo test(alternate of IELTS due to Covid days) and scored 130. Right after completing my bachelor's, I applied to 4 universities with the help of Asim Sahab(my career counselor) Depaul University, Saint Louis University, Oregon state university, and I got accepted in all of them with partial scholarships for spring intake 2021. 
After getting admits, I thought why not apply to some well-ranked university. I dropped off my plans for Spring intake 2021 and applied to Northeastern University(Ranked under top 50 universities nationally according to US News ranking) by myself with the help of Zaryab(A great friend of mine). I got admit from it for the fall intake 2021.
After getting i20, I applied for an appointment from US embassy ISL. I got an appointment for 13th July. 
6th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 13/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
It took almost 1 hour I believe by going through the routine process from shuttle service to embassy.
I wasn't aware of that bald guy who was famous for rejections. Unfortunately, I had to give my interview to the same VO. He rejected a student before me.
Me: Good morning.
VO: No reply.
Vo: Can you pass me your documents?
Me: Sure.
Vo: Let's take fingerprints first. 
Me: I did the same and asked if it is done?
Vo: Yeah.
Me: Cool.
Vo: Why are you going to the US?
Me: I am going to us to pursue my master's in project management from Northeastern University, Boston. 
Vo: Why did you choose this school?
Me: I asked him to repeat the question as his voice was not clear.
Vo: He repeated the question.
Me: Besides its ranking that comes under the top 50 schools nationally according to US news ranking I choose NEU due to its course curriculum that offers different electives, workshops and a capstone project,  (Vo interrupted me)
Vo: Who is paying for your trip?
Me: Father.
Vo: What does he do?
Me: I was explaining about my father job and business( He interrupted again)
Vo: Unfortunately, I cannot approve your visa and the reason is mentioned in this paper(yellow sheet, here he handed me two yellow sheets, I was like o bhai mere pas dher laga huwa yellow sheets ka already 
 )
Me; thanks and left the embassy with a shattered heart as I was really prepared for this attempt and made many changes in my profile this time. Anyhow, I decided to reapply as It seems unfair to me without knowing the reason he rejected me even he was not listening to my answers. 
I did not bother to change anything in my profile as I did not exactly know the reason for rejection. 
7th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 30/07/2021 / 8:00 Am
Before me, one student visa got approved who got rejected previously and the visa officer asked him what changes he made in his profile he said no changes as he was not confident last time and now he is. He got his visa approved. 
after that student officer asked me to move forward.
Me: good morning how are you doing?
Vo: He said good thank you,
Vo: I see you have been refused already so what changes do you bring out this time?
Me: I don’t feel to make any changes in my profile since I have gotten admission to a highly ranked university in USA with a course curriculum that is perfectly aligned with my future plans of Pakistan, 
After listening to that he was continuously seeing his computer screen, I guess he must be checking my previous interview experiences,
After a few minutes, he told me I cannot approve your visa the reason is the same as before, 
I said is it permanent rejection as this is my 7th attempt, 
He said, you have too many rejections and you need to change the circumstances. 
I left the counter.
I thought to change my sponsor and added my mother as my sponsor in my DS160. I thought to try changing sponsor so maybe it could work. 
8th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Northeastern university
Course: Master of Science in Project management
Intake: Fall 2021
Status: Rejected
Date&time: 11/08/2021 / 10:15 Am
VO was a big beard guy with his 50-55. 
Me: Hi sir, how are you doing?
VO: good morning, can you please scan your fingerprints.
I did, then VO told me to pass my documents. 
VO: what is the purpose of your trip?
Me: I am going to us to pursue master's in project management from northeastern uni, Boston.
VO: who will bear the expenses?
Me: My parents.
VO: What do they do?
Told about the parent business and job. In the end I said, we have a savings of 52k$. Do you want to see the bank statement?
VO: no, not needed.
VO: Have you ever visited any country?
Me: No, I never visited any country.
VO: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Me: Yes I do have.
VO: what do they do?
Me: One of my brothers is a chemical engineer and working as senior chemical eng in service industries, other siblings are still studying.
Then he started typing and after 30-45 seconds he said, Us laws are really strict and I cannot approve your visa.
I said, sir, is there anything wrong with my profile as this is my 8th attempt for f1 visa? 
VO: there is nothing wrong with your profile and you did not change anything in your profile.
I said I have changed my sponsor this time as I added my mother to my sponsor list.
VO: sorry.
I said thank you and left the counter.
After this attempt, I decided to change my university and reapply again.  I was also thinking to change the embassy but dropped off this plan as in my point of view embassy does not matter at all. 
I deferred my admission to Depaul university to spring intake 2022 and applied for the i20. I got an electronic i20 at the end of august and paid the fee again for the appointment.
9th attempt
Embassy: ISL
University: Depaul University, Chicago
Course: Master of Science in business analytics ($6k scholarship)
Intake: Spring 2022
Status: Approved
Date&time: 17/09/2021 / 8:00 Am
Vo was a really great guy in his 50+. Before me, the visa of one girl got approved. Luckily, I did not see the bald guy there and there were two VO's that were taking the interviews. I observed they were approving visas for most of the candidates. I was the last one being interviewed in the embassy. My visa interviews went smoothly. 
Me: Good morning officer, how are you doing?
Vo: Hi, good.
Vo: Fingerprints, I said is it done? , he said yeah. 
Vo: So, Mr.... you were there before uhmm..... He scanned my DS160.
Me: Yes, my visa has been refused 3 times this year. I want to say something. Actually, last time visa officer told me to change something in my profile and reapply. Now, I have changed my university with a more popular and advanced STEM degree that has a promising career in Pakistan. My intentions are to get my master's degree from the USA and come back to Pakistan to work as a business analyst in one of my dream companies that is Nestle. 
Vo: hmmm...
Vo: He was seeing the previous visa officer's comments on his screen, he got up and went back to talk with someone, I guess he was speaking about the visa officer who had rejected me before. He made some funny comments with his colleague and smiling.
Vo: So, you have applied to this embassy?
Me: Yes, I have applied to the ISL embassy. 
Vo: Have you ever applied to the KHI embassy?
Me: No, never. 
Vo: He scanned my ds160 3-4 times. I don't know why. He then wrote down his comments. After some time, Ok Mr.... you are good to go, your visa has been approved and you will get your passport within 5 days. He returned back i20, ds160, blue sheet(Approval sheet) and put my passport in the basket.
Me; Thanks, officer, thank you so much. 
Vo: Have a nice stay in the states while smiling. 
Me: Inside me( yeah yeah buddy why not).
I was literally crying when I was leaving the embassy, it was like a dream come true for me. 
I would like to thanks a few members of this group who helped me a lot during my interview experiences.

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Status: Approved, received passport in three days.
Date: April 13, 2022
Consulate/Embassy: Islamabad.
Major and University: Bachelor’s in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts Amherst.
My interview was scheduled for 11 AM, but I got to the Embassy at around 8 AM and the guards allowed me to enter early. I was out of the embassy by 9:15-ish. The interview itself only lasted 3 minutes.
I was asked the following questions:
1: What’s your major.
2: Why did you choose this university.
3: How many did you apply to.
4: Show me your scholarship letter.
5: What does your father do.
6: How much land does your father own.
7: Has he ever travelled outside Pakistan.
8: Have you travelled outside Pakistan in the last five years.
9: What do you intend to do after the degree.
The only thing the VO saw was my admissions letter with scholarship (14,000 USD per year, and funding from my father is 45,000 USD).
There are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about the Visa process here.
If you can:
1: Establish yourself as a genuine student;
2: Show concrete proof of funding;
3: Convince the VO you will return to Pakistan,
You will NEVER be denied the Visa.
1: Establishing yourself as a genuine student:
One of the best — or maybe the only way — to convince the VO that you’re a genuine student is to apply and get accepted to top public or private universities. I applied to 16 public colleges (all top 100 for my major) and I was accepted to 13, Alhumdulillah. There is no such thing as a “visa ratio”; as long as your university is highly ranked for your major, and is selective, you’ll get the visa.
My advice: Please do not hire consultants to apply to universities on your behalf. They only have very low ranking universities that will negatively impact your chances of getting a Visa.
2: Proof of funding:
It’s very important to convince the VO that you/your sponsor can fund at least a full year of living and tuition in the States. My VO did not even ask to see my bank statements, and that was probably because I told her what my father did, and that I had received more scholarships from other universities but ultimately chose UMass because it had a better ranked program — UMass did not offer me the highest scholarship from my list. This convinced the VO that my father can, indeed, fund my stay in the States.
3: Strong ties to home country:
Convince the VO that your entire family is in Pakistan and — if your father owns a business — tell them that you’ll inherit the business. This is usually ample proof.
Also, English speaking skills and confidence go a LONG way. I believe my interview was so short because I was speaking English very naturally and confidently. Which may be why the VO did not even ask for more documents.
I understand that a lot of applicants may not be able to speak English fluently, and I would strongly advise them to invest in English speaking classes at least three months before the interview. If you’re not going for a language program, it’s imperative to have a strong grip on English.

VISA APPROVED
Date: 19thMay 2023
Program: PhD in Engineering Education (Fully funded)
University: State University of New York at Buffalo
location: US Embassy Islamabad
VO 
was a middle aged lady with glasses
Me: Good Morning Officer (Meanwhile I had already passed my passport, I 20, SEVIS and DS-160)
VO: Good Morning. Is it your first time here?
Me: Yes, I have never been here before.
VO: So where are you going?
Me:  I plan to go to SUNY Buffalo for my PhD in Engineering Education and it is a fully funded offer with an assistantship.
VO: How did you come to know about this PhD?
Me: Well the desire to do my PhD in this field stemmed from my surroundings. Throughout my educational and professional career, I noticed that Engineering is considered to be male dominant field. Somewhere deep down I wanted to change that and for this exact reason I plan to do my research in “Diversity and inclusion in Engineering education”.  (I was not interrupted at all by VO so I kept on talking). Although PhD in this field is being offered by other US universities as well but I chose this university cuz I had read a few research papers of Prof xyz so I dropped  her an email expressing my interest to work with her to which she replied then we had a zoom a session and she agreed to supervise me provided I can get myself admitted by meeting the requirements of graduate school. I then applied at uni portal and not only did I get admitted but I was also offered a full scholarship.
That was a long answer but I just did not wanna stop until I was interrupted so I kept going.
VO:  So you have assistantship?
Me: Yes I do have it.
VO: So what exactly would you do in your research?
Me: There would basically be 3 major research questions and then went on to state all 3 of them.
VO: Tell me how as a male you came to realize the underrepresentation of women in engineering?
Till now, VO would ask me a question and then would start typing on the computer and would occasionally make an eye contact. But after asking this question, she took both her hands off keyboard and placed on the table as if she was very eager to listen to my answer.
Me:  When I was doing my bachelors, there were only 2 girls in a class of 50 people. During the fours years of my professional career, there was only a handful of representation of female members of the society and even those who were there, they would put in a resign after sometime. So I always had it in back of my hand that if we are not taking measures to make our educational institutes diverse and inclusive then we would have to bear severe economical repercussions.
VO: Do you have bachelor's in STEM?
Me: Yes, I did my bachelor's in electronics engineering.
VO: Which school would you be joining in UB?
Me: School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
VO kept typing for few seconds and then out came the golden words. Your visa is approved and she handed me over the blue slip.
Well in my view giving confident answers by maintaining  eye contact with the VO does make a massive difference. VO did not ask for anything from me not even my own CV. The other thing is being proactive in the interview can pass you off as someone who knows what he is doing.

Me:  No I have not.
VO: Do you have any relatives in the US?
Me: No I do not.
VO: Who is going to Sponsor you ?
Me: My mother will take care of all my expenses.
VO: What does she do ?
Me: She owns multiple rental properties and she has her business.
VO: How many properties does she manage ?
Me: About 12.
VO: What are you going to do after graduation?
Me : The skills this course offers is ideal for the market when I come back to Pakistan and I see a lucrative opportunity. I want to be a product manager which pays 6 times more than what I’m making right now.
VO: Alright I will approve your Visa.
Me: ok thank you.
THE TRICK IS to be Confident and natural like these questions don’t even matter and don’t get stuck while speaking. Try to stay to the point and not give a comeplete story for every answer you give.
My Experience: I came alone to a place near the embassy to stay. At 1 am I realized My mother hadn’t signed my I-20 I forgot to tell her to sign it.
My friend photostated my I-20 from the call center I worked at and delivered it to my home. 
At 2 am my parents left from Peshawar to give me the signed form. Then they asked to drop me off even tho it was just 5:30, I agreed and found out The roads were blocked and we had to take a long route.
I found out no InDriver no careem no Uber were available at the time. So it was a miracle my family came to drop me off. 
If I hadn’t forgotten to sign my form, my family wouldn’t have had come to drop me off and there’s a chance I would have messed things up 
But Thanks to Allah almighty things worked out.
Moral of the story if it’s written for you it will happen if it’s not Allah has better plans for you. Try try again
Best of Luck everyone May Allah bless us All

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Embassy: Islamabad
Status : Approved
Applied by myself
After greeting, VO said my name and I nodded in response
Why are you going to US
I'm going for studies
You're going to Harvard. Great. What are you going to study?
Differential equations
Differential equations?
Yes, my concentration is differential equations although it says liberal arts on the document.
Why do you want to study these?
I'm a teacher and need to learn them so I can teach it to my students.
How was the application process?
(VO was asking about admission application and I thought he meant visa application) Most people said I should get an advisor or counsellor but I did it myself, didn't find it very complicated.
(VO interrupted) 
Did you apply and get accepted for it or just signed up?
I had to apply and go through the admission process.
OK. How do you plan to pay for it?
From my savings.
How much  do you have?
I shared the amount.
Are you married?
Yes
Any kids?
No.
Is your wife going with you?
No she's not. (I wanted to explain why, but didn't)
Have you changed your name before?
No, I haven't.
OK. It says you were Akmal (not real name) before?
My family calls me that endearly. It hasn't been my official name. 
OK I'm approving your visa. You'll get your passport in some days.
I asked how long it will take and he said its on the blue slip.
VO kept typing throughtout these questions and there were long pauses between questions. He didn't ask me for any supporting documents apart from the usual sevis fee, visa fee, DS 160 and Passport.
I was very nervous because he refused 3 people before me and only one approval. At the last minute I told myself that this person is a gatekeeper and I have to go to US nomatterwhat. I focused on why I was there and where I wanted to be, instead of focusing on people around me. Confidence is key. He could have refused me for my ans to last question but I clarified and was confident which I think helped.
ایسا لگ رہا ہے جیسے برسوں کا بوجھ ہٹ گیا ہو۔ 
I was refused visa for UK 4 years ago despite having an offer from University of Cambridge and it took me 3 years to save the money for this program.
I'd like to thank Tahir Haneef for helping me clear my doubts and for questions I had. I'd also like to thank you all for this group and the moderators. I did multiple mock interviews using different questions from previous posts here.
BTW nobody tells you about the whole gruesome process of going to shuttle stop, the exorbitant fee for it, multiple queues and security checks. The embassy building is daunting. Also, from the moment I stepped out of embassy to until I left the shuttle stop, every person I met asked me for mithayi after seeing the blue slip. I hope our workers learn some self respect and stop the begging.

AOA
I finally received a visa after 40 days of administrative processing.
University: Cleveland State University
Sponsor: Cousin living in the US
Embassy: Islamabad
Interview date: 03 Aug 2022
Passport received: 20 Sep 2022
Interview experience: VO only asked about my program and current job while constantly typing. He was not asking anything else but just typing, I was telling him about my graduation, sponsor and future goals. He was just saying OK in reply. He then told me he will need some more information via email and returned my passport.
So, i want to share my experience what observed so far, it might be helpful for someone.
First and the most important thing is the believe in Allah and Duas from parents.
Practice interview in front of a mirror or laptop camera.
Prepare the answers to common questions from VO and analyze them until you get confidence that they are according to your case because only you know the best about yourself. Tell him like a story and show your accomplishments. No doubt, university and sponsorship matter but the most important thing that matters is how you are presenting your case if it makes sense then all OK. Your whole profile matter.
One last important thing which we often ignore, please be dressed as it depicts how serious you are about your study or the concerned post. They judge you from the very moment when you get up from the chair and move towards the window.
Best of luck all.
Thanks!

Thanks.
Important points you should consider before applying for the F1 visa.
1)If you going for studies in the USA then you have to do the entire process without the support of any consultant, otherwise, your visa will be rejected.
2)You have to be very confident while you are communicating with the visa officer.
3) Your dress matters a lot, always prefer to wear simple and dark-colored clothes for the visa interview.
4)Always try to work on your grooming if you are planning for the visa interview (Beard, Hair Cut, Hair Colour, and Clean Shave) Everything should be up to date.
5) Try to keep a smile on your face while giving the interview.
6) If you do not know how to apply to a US university or even how to apply for a visa then you have to select the other country, USA is not the right place for you. Your input really matters.
7) Stop giving answers in YES or NO (Your answer should be at least one line).
Thank you so much Rana Ibrar and Mahwish Moazzam for your continuous effort and support. That was impossible without your assistance. God Bless you.

Interview date = 15 Aug
Status = approved 
V.O= long beard man
Time slot = 10.30 am
First Question = how many admits you got
Answer = i got admission in 3 out of 4 universities in which i applied. Unfortunately wasn’t able to make it to university of rochester. Also named the universities and their business schools in which i got admit
2nd = why this xyz university 
Ans= Told MSBA at xyz is ranked among top 100 MsBa programs in the world according to Qs rankings. Also told in detail about the diversity of curriculum 
3rd= how many brothers you have
Ans = told 1 and also about his profession
4Th= who is financing you
Ans= told i have got scholarship of about 5K and have personal savings of around 8k and the rest of cost which is almost 43 k is going to be paid by my father. 
He asked about his business and i gave him the details 
5th= he asked me about my mother’s sister who lives in US
Ans= i told him that i have no immediate relative but about other relatives I already had mentioned in my Ds-160. He didn’t bother about it because she lives in different state than the state in which I have got acceptance..
Conclusion = 
Before the start of interview i had got the confidence that I would get visa because VO gave quite time to a student before me and listened him comprehensively before rejecting his visa so i got the feeling that if he gives me that chance i ll have the chances to get the visa. No doubt it is game of luck . And also the VO who is quite young was also giving alot of opportunity to speak . Women VO had more interviews from non-F1 categories and she put most of these cases to administration processing

Sorry for the delayed post. 
I got my visa Approved on the 15th of August. Got my Passport after 15 days.
Islambad Embassy
The Officer was Long beard Guy.
Indiana Institute of Tech
The interview was pretty quick and straightforward.
Who is your sponsor?
Father's business?
How many branches?
How many Employees?
Why Gap?
Have you been to the U.S before?
Is it an Online Institution?
That was about it I guess If I remember correctly. I just wanted to post here because I used to read people's stories and get inspired to an extent so I thought it was my obligation to do the same.
There are no tricks Guys. Just know your stuff.
Read as much as possible about your course, your university, your Gap if any, and your sponsor's business (how many employees, the total income etc). The more you read about your stuff the more confident you will be.
Just be confident, be fluent. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's going to a 2-3 minutes interview that will change your life. 
One more thing, don't think about 2nd attempt. Consider your first attempt the last one and get the visa.
Good Luck!
