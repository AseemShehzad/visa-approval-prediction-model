Hi,
I have been accepted to Carnegie Mellon MS business analytics program. 
I would InshaAllah be applying for F1. Does saying that my grandfather is going to sponser my education makes my case weak even if I prove the funds considering he is well off and can easily sponser my education. I can’t pay from my father’s account due to some personal reasons.

Salam everyone. I have been accepted for MS in Business Analytics program Fall 2023 in following universities: 
•University of Dallas, Irving Texas
•Mercer University, Georgia
With which university should I proceed further. Anyone from these universities?

Alhamdulilah! I 
got accepted to Fully Funded Masters 
Scholarship in Computer Science from 
Canada
 as well as 
America
.
HOW YOU CAN GET IT AS WELL?
1 line answer is: "" Good and Novel Research Work "" (Publication is not required).
A bit of 
detailed method
 (How I got the scholarship):
I have 
3.3 CGPA, and NO Publications
 but my research work is meaningful that I could write about it thoroughly in my Statement of Purpose.
Conduct good and meaningful research work in your home country (it means come with a problem and spend a few months or a year in solving that problem or problems in a good university or research lab under other professors, who can guide you).
Apply in Masters Thesis Programs only.
Write Statement of Purpose which should mainly focus on your research work and future prospects and reflects why this particular professor and university is the best match with your work (relate your work with prospective supervisor in the SOP, write his research paper titles and relate it with yours in 1-2 lines).
Get 3 Letters of Recommendations from your university (these letters should support and highlight your research work and what you have written in your SOP, it should not be generic at all (as most university professors give generic letters and they are useless).
Now, Choose universities you intend to apply based on your CGPA (like if you have just 3.0, then University of Toronto's scholarship doesn't make sense in your case) and follow these steps.
Visit Faculty profiles (related to your desired department of study), of let's say 20 different universities.
See the Google scholar and Personal Website of the Professors of that department you want to apply in. 
List down which 3 professors best matches with your research work and domain in those universities.
If there is no professor which matches with your research work, then do not apply in that university.
Write about his work and relate that to your work in your SOP.
Write him an email as well (after applying) that how his work was related and how you can assist him in his work and how his work fascinates you.
It would need you to read Abstracts of his recent research papers (to write, and relate such things in SOP)
Weightage to this method is 50% and 
rest of the 50%
 is Praying to Allah
Now Wait and be good to others. 
GREAT THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES AND HELP OTHERS.

I am unsure of how to proceed with the activation process and would appreciate any guidance or assistance from individuals who are familiar with the process. If anyone has knowledge on how to activate an eRaider account, kindly share your insights in the comments section.
Your help would be greatly appreciated, as activating my

My F-1 visa got accepted today at Islamabad consulate, Alhamdulillah. VO just asked me the reason for going to USA and what would I do with my PhD degree in future.
However, my husband's (F-2) visa got into administrative processing due to his field in TAL and his current job. He clearly explained to the VO that he wouldn't be working in the states as he is not allowed to do so. VO returned his passport with 221g and said that there's nothing to be worried about, he just needs 
to upload his resume and publications list.
Has anyone faced a similar situation? If yes, how much time did it take for F-2 processing if F-1 was already approved?

Hi, I recently got accepted at a school in chicago for a psychology program(Masters) 
I had a couple questions, if anyone of you can help me out a little.
1- My current school is around 13k per semester; however i dont want to start studying here. Im just planning to use their i20 to get visa. Since they have a low acceptance rate, im assuming it’ll be helpful in getting the visa through them. 
Is 
it possible that i transfer to a community college before even starting my semester at my original school? 
(If yes, are there any you guys can suggest?)
2- Should i apply to these community colleges from pakistan( right now) or when i come ? (Given that i do get my visa approved) 
3- Can you give me a step to step guide as to how i will be able to transfer right away ? If anyone has been through the process, id love to hear your experience. 
(The community colleges i checked have a deadline of august 15th for fall 2023) 
4- Can i work off campus on my very first month of coming to the states or am i only allowed to work on campus( given that i will not have a SSN initially) 
Any other piece of advice you can give me, id love to hear it. Please help a sis out 
 
Thanks!

Hi everyone.
Just wanted to get some info.
I have been accepted from the following universities:
1- University of Iowa (MS Data Science)
2- 
Michigan State University (MS Data Science)
3- Wayne State University (MS Data Science & Business Analytics)
4- San Francisco State University (MS Data Science & Artificial Intelligence)
It is a cliched question, but which university should I go for, keeping factors such as living cost, tuition, job opportunities, etc. Unfortunately, haven't got any financial/graduate assistantship yet. Will it be a wise option to raise student loan from mpower/prodigy finance?

I got accepted into a kind not well-known state university(not very diversed , predominantly white ) they gave me a 12k a year scholarship. A 75% off the first semester. The total fees are around 21k$ a year for a master’s in CS. There is also 13k for room & board, supplies. They said I need to take the GRE before the end of the first semester. I know the decision is mine, but does it worth it if the university is ranked low ? How  likely are they to add more $ to the current 
scholarship if I request it? Thanks

Hello and Eid Mubarak!
I'm planning to go for my post-grad studies this Fall-23 and have been accepted by the University of San Francisco in their Energy Systems Program. The University has offered me a $10k scholarship for the whole academic year, and the rest will be funded through student loan (cos I don't want to use my PKR savings to fund my studies). 
Total per annum expenses are (incl. living, and other expenses) $50k. (I will be showing proof of funds of around 30k; 20k 
savings account and 10k scholarship)
My questions from the community are:
1) would there be any issue in the F1 visa processing? 
2) Do i need to show complete Proof of Funds of $50k? Or should i tell them that part of the cost will be funded through student loan?
3) I'm funding my education from my own savings. My family won't be supporting me (coz they don't have that much money or source of income). I have 6 years of professional working experience. 
Your help is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Can someone please guide on what should I do? or help me find any external funding? 
Is 
it a wise to opt for a student role?

F1 Visa Interview Experience
Embassy: Islamabad
Status : Approved
Applied by myself
After greeting, VO said my name and I nodded in response
Why are you going to US
I'm going for studies
You're going to Harvard. Great. What are you going to study?
Differential equations
Differential equations?
Yes, my concentration is differential equations although it says liberal arts on the document.
Why do you want to study these?
I'm a teacher and need to learn them so I can teach it to my students.
How was the application process?
(VO was asking about admission application and I thought he meant visa application) Most people said I should get an advisor or counsellor but I did it myself, didn't find it very complicated.
(VO interrupted) 
Did you apply and get accepted for it or just signed up?
I had to apply and go through the admission process.
OK. How do you plan to pay for it?
From my savings.
How much  do you have?
I shared the amount.
Are you married?
Yes
Any kids?
No.
Is your wife going with you?
No she's not. (I wanted to explain why, but didn't)
Have you changed your name before?
No, I haven't.
OK. It says you were Akmal (not real name) before?
My family calls me that endearly. It hasn't been my official name. 
OK I'm approving your visa. You'll get your passport in some days.
I asked how long it will take and he said its on the blue slip.
VO kept typing throughtout these questions and there were long pauses between questions. He didn't ask me for any supporting documents apart from the usual sevis fee, visa fee, DS 160 and Passport.
I was very nervous because he refused 3 people before me and only one approval. At the last minute I told myself that this person is a gatekeeper and I have to go to US nomatterwhat. I focused on why I was there and where I wanted to be, instead of focusing on people around me. Confidence is key. He could have refused me for my ans to last question but I clarified and was confident which I think helped.
ایسا لگ رہا ہے جیسے برسوں کا بوجھ ہٹ گیا ہو۔ 
I was refused visa for UK 4 years ago despite having an offer from University of Cambridge and it took me 3 years to save the money for this program.
I'd like to thank Tahir Haneef for helping me clear my doubts and for questions I had. I'd also like to thank you all for this group and the moderators. I did multiple mock interviews using different questions from previous posts here.
BTW nobody tells you about the whole gruesome process of going to shuttle stop, the exorbitant fee for it, multiple queues and security checks. The embassy building is daunting. Also, from the moment I stepped out of embassy to until I left the shuttle stop, every person I met asked me for mithayi after seeing the blue slip. I hope our workers learn some self respect and stop the begging.

I approached  few professors for assistantship for Masters via email, few of them asked me to get accepted in university first by admission committee. I don’t know what does that mean if i get admission so will they provide me assistantships? And yesterday one of the professors really appreciated my work and scheduled a zoom meeting with me on Tuesday to discuss further . My question is how and what should i be asking during the zoom meeting in regards to assistantships?

Me:  your visa is rejected , ( failed to show ties to home country)
Anyways, didnt apply to US again after this and applied for canada through SDS and i got accepted.
If you dont get accepted in US in the first try, rather than begging them in 2nd or 3rd try for a visa , just change your country because some of us are not born with silver spoons in our mouth , nor have any businesses to show ties.

Visa Status: Approved
Profile:
University: Northeastern University
Program: MS in HR Management
Undergrad GPA: 3.75
IELTS: 8.0
Questions VO asked me:
VO: Is it a masters program?
ME: Yes, masters.
VO: Why are you going to the US?
ME: To pursue my masters degree in Human Resource Management from Northeastern University in Boston.
VO: Did you apply to any other universities?
ME: Yes, I applied to two other universities. Boston University and University of Notre Dame, in Indiana. 
VO: Were you accepted to any of those?
ME: I was rejected by Notre Dame but accepted into Boston University.
VO: Have you ever travelled abroad?
ME: No, I haven't
VO: So you have a brother in the US?
ME: Yes, my brother lives in US. He is also a graduate of Northeastern University. And is currently working there in a company. 
VO: Why did you choose to pursue this program now?
ME: Well I graduated last year with my bachelors degree. Since then I've been working in a school as an English teacher. I was made HOD of the English department & I became interested in HR management. And since there weren't many good options for this degree in Pakistan, I thought why not go to the US.
VO: Who is your sponsor?
ME: My father is my sponsor.
VO: What does your sponsor do?
ME: He is a recently retired police officer from Punjab police. He currently owns a pharmacy business in Lahore.
VO: Ok, I'm approving your visa. 
I found the VO to be very professional. He would interrupt most my answers by saying ""Ok got it"" when he wanted me to stop talking and I would. I was honest and confident. That's the key. Also your choice of University really matters, in my opinion. 
3 guys were rejected before me. 1 girl who went before me was approved.  They were all re-applying. This was my first attempt. 
Good luck everyone!

Dear Group Members,
One of the professors from University of Florida has accepted me to enroll in a PhD project under her supervision. The project is fully funded. Also, she has offered me to work as a teaching assistant at the department as well. 
Currently, I am clueless about the next steps (e.g., Visa processing and documentation). I would really appreciate if you all could guide me on the following points:
1) 
What type of visa options are available in my case? I am married and would take my spouse with me.
2) Besides degrees, passport and acceptance letter, what other documents would be needed?
3) How long does the whole process take?

Passed me my docs with rejection slip and said sorry you’re not eligible for the visa under section 214B. 
Can anyone guide me where i went wrong as I cant seem to understand with only two questions how he rejected me. My D160 was perfect also funding and my family ties are also good as I’ll have to come back to takeover my family business.

VO: Why do you want to go now?
I want to pursue a master's degree in xyz program for abc university. 
VO: Why this program?
It is a growing field and related to my undergraduate degree as well as current job. 
VO: Who is your sponsor?
My sponsor is xyz and he has a business based in pakistan. (Gave some details of his business here to avoid usual follow up questions regarding sponsor. 
VO: Your visa is approved. 
The interview was of one minute at max. I had an upper hand because of being a issued a tourist visa earlier but most people were getting accepted that day. 
A few pointers for people who would be applying:
- Aim for universities that have a QS ranking of under 500. 
- Apply to multiple universities (3-5) as it shows the student's interest in studying. 
- Try applying to a field that is related to your current work experience or undergraduate degree. 
All they really see is the student's authenticity and his ability to come back after studies. If they have any doubt about the student staying there or going to earn money, they will reject your visa. 
All the best, may Allah make the process easy for everyone.

Hi ,
I've been accepted in the University of Potomac and my sponsor is my uncle who is currently living in US while my elder brother is also in Saudia Arabia. Will getting sponsorship from my uncle raise any issue at the time of interview while i shown the bank statement of my uncle on Affidavit form? should i write the same sponsor on DS-160 too or may i write my brother's financial status?
"

I just got accepted at University of Central Missouri. I wanted to get your honest feedback about whether should I show the financial statement of a family friend living in USA or family friend in Canada or of an uncle living in Pakistan. Which one reduce the visa rejection chances?

Hello group members!
I want to do undergraduate in CS from MIT. I know it's extremely hard to land at this institution but I have a great academic record and academic achievements however I don't have done any major extra curricular activities. Alumni's of MIT suggest that you should have something in your profile that MIT lacks and you have to show them that you are able to fulfill the required gap in order to get accepted. CS is a very competitive field to get into, so 
please tell me which domain with CS combined should I choose in order to land at MIT? What extra curriculars should I do? And which thing that MIT lacks and what they are looking for in the students nowadays?
Please note that I am looking for some serious advice. So, if you don't have any advice, please don't make your input here.

MS in mathematics from NUST I was admitted to Ph.D. mathematics at a fully funded scholarship at RPI.
Interview experience.
VO: Good morning pass me your i-20 and passport.
Me. 
Good morning. yes sure
VO. Why do you want to get higher studies?
Me. Well, my father is a teacher and he teaches me basic mathematics in my school. He developed my interest in mathematics and support me in my higher studies. I got a silver medal in MSc and also did my MS from a top-ranked university in Pakistan. And now I want to be a professor after getting Ph.D.
VO. What are you doing since your last degree? (I didn't understand what he said and didn't ask VO to repeat the question).
Me. (I didn't remember what I answered.)
VO. What are you doing now?
Me. I have been teaching in a higher secondary school since April 2019.
VO. Have you visited the US before?
Me. No, I haven't.
VO. Why you are not doing PhD in Pakistan?
Me. I completed my master's from NUST Islamabad which is a top-ranked university in Pakistan. So I don't have a better option after getting MS from NUST. I have received offers from different countries but all of those offers were without funding. During this time I got an opportunity to study in the US with funding, and I accepted this offer.
VO. I can not issue a visa this time. Thank you.
During the interview, VO looks at my i-20 almost 4 times.

Hello,
I am from Pakistan. I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s Masters program, and received a financial aid award that does not cover personal, food and travel expenses (along with other services and amenities). I wanted to write here to ask about alternative sources of funding (both International/American and Pakistani) that could help me finance my graduate study in the United States/at Bard and cover the remaining costs. I have spoken to their financial aid 
officer, but thought it might be worth a shot, to ask here and get your suggestions. 
Thank you very much.

Asslamualikum, members.
A dumb question:
Should the physical photograph submitted to the consulate on the interview day match the picture uploaded for your DS-160?
The 
picture uploaded for my DS-160 was snapped professionally with a mobile against a white wall in my home and was successfully accepted. So, should I get this picture printed from a picture studio, or can I get a new one snapped in a different attire?
Thank you!

Hello,
I have recently been accepted into Bard College’s graduate program (in NYC), with a financial aid award that covers tuition, Bard-sponsored housing/accommodation, and health insurance. However, expenses related to travel and food will not be waived and I’d be entirely responsible for managing them. Moreover, the program does not have any on-campus jobs/employment (I’m not allowed to live/work off-campus) and I would quite literally be on my own. I wanted to write here 
to ask for advice: Should I say yes to this offer? Is it possible to be a bit too frugal in New York and save money/stop myself from needless spending? Would I be able to manage? How can I bring down the remaining costs that have not been covered by my financial aid award? Any sort of assistance/piece of advice is welcomed.
Thank you very much.

By any chance does Visa Officer know how much Universities did I applied to?
Cause I have applied at only one and have been accepted there, but I'm worried that applying to only one university may give VO the wrong impression.
So when he asks, How much Universities did you applied to?
Can 
I say that I applied to Three other Universities with (name and details about them)?
Thanks

Appointment date: 24th october 2022
Visa issued: 25th october 2022
Embassy location: Karachi
Visa status: Approved on 1st attempt alhamdulillah(Arrived in USA on 28th December 2022)
Interviewer was a short haired blondie on counter 3
***PS. The interview was long as I tried to drag it as much as possible, so I will try to write as much as I can remember bear with the long post I hope it can be helpful***
Me: Hello
VO: Hey, how are you?
Me: I am good, I hope you are doing well too.
VO: thank you, May I have your picture
Me: Sure, here you go?
VO: How much time has passed since you got this captured?
Me: Maybe 2 months or a little over I don’t remember exactly.
VO: Is your picture edited?
Me: Oh yes, I guess it is as I got it taken at a studio
VO: Alright, may I have your documents please?
Me: You mean the bundle they made at first security check?
VO: Yeah that’s the one
Me: Here you go!
VO: Thank you (takes a glance at my documents and started typing away on her computer vigorously)
Me: Pleasure is all mine!
VO: So what are you going to study?
Me: I am going for higher studies, masters in civil engineering precisely.
VO: (continues typing while asking) Which university did you applied to?
Me: Oh I applied to 4 universities and got accepted at Lamar university
VO: Where else did you applied to?
Me: I applied at 3 other universities *told the names*, I originally planned to go for bridgeford but the communication with them was not so efficient and Lamar had swift responses so I thought why not!
VO: Can you tell me about your bachelors course?
Me: You mean the whole curriculum or the background of what it was about?
VO: Yeah the background (still focusing on her computer)
***BTW a handful tip try to get the interviewers’ attention because that is actually an indication that she is interested in knowing about you and most likely to grant you a visa so stop making robotic internet responses come up with your own originality***
Me: I explained about my bachelors and research major
VO: Ok so who is funding your studies?
Me: Well ofcorse my father is funding my studies as I am a student and I don’t work plus I also was able to get scholarship on merit basis
VO: What does your father do?
Me: He is a businessman
VO: What kind of business he runs?
Me: Oh he rents out heavy machineries for road carpet finish and supplies bitumen.
VO: Sorry, what bitumen?
Me: Uh you know the finish product of the road, small black rocks used for carpeting the roads.
VO: Oh yeah I got that, so why did you chose civil engineering for masters?
(She was continuously typing at this point too and I was trying to drag the convo as much as I can so she can start talking to me actually face to face)
Me: Ok so the story goes way long back, my father supported and encouraged me a lot regarding my education and such as I have no brother he placed all his expectations on me in this regard and trained me for such so that when I grow up I can help him with the business handling and that’s the reason it became my passion to actually learn about what my father does and to help him improve I wanted to learn about it from a worldly aspect so that we can adapt the technology and methods used around the world.
VO: Oh wow that’s cool!
(She glanced at me and started typing away again and I stood there waiting but seconds felt like hours and it felt like the pause was too long so I started talking again)
Me: While doing my thesis I got lucky and my bachelors research preprint got published too which was a milestone for me.
VO: (finally she leave her computer leaned on the table and turned her whole attention towards me and that felt like an achievement at that moment TBH) Tell me more about it.
Me: So my research was about the airport management at Karachi Jinnah Intl Airport and its aspects.
VO: How is airport management related to what you want to study?
Me: Yeah the infrastructure and management aspect you know.
VO: Ohhh now that’s cool, Congratulations your visa is approved!
Me: Thank you!
***She was giving me the yellow approval slip alongwith my documents bundle from the small window and suddenly stopped either ends of the documents in each of our hands***
VO: When does your classes start?
Me: Oh they start from 17th Jan 2023.
VO: Alright you are free to go
(I took the document and went straight outside without seeing back and out where I cam from in)
***Remember you can be nervous it doesn’t matters because the officers are well aware of that no matter how hard you try to hide it it’s just going to get worse so do not bother with that but don’t lose your composure in the process this is the thing you need to work on. Never ever express your gratitudes and emotions and joyness when your visa gets approved as it is going to convey that you are desperate and most highly chance of getting rejected because they can do it that is what they are checking from the very beginning till the end, they are not interested in you because of all those robotic answers they hear all day long so make them actually talk to you, and last but not the least recite some duas for ease all the time on the way to the embassy till you stand in front of the interviewer, don’t think about acception or rejection that’s the main thing and you will automatically start to talk without any hesitation***
That’s all for now if you have any further questions feel free to ring my inbox and best of luck for thise who have upcoming interviews believe in Allah have faith in yourself and ace the interview afterall you are paying a hefty amount just to get to talk with the person and still you have to be nervous from thise who are taking your money, give yourself a prep talk and you are good to go.
Best Regards

who can serve as a financial sponsor for an international student studying in the United States?
An F-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for international students who want to study in the United States. When it comes to sponsorship for an F-1 visa, the term ""sponsor"" typically refers to the financial sponsor who provides proof of funds to cover the student's expenses, including tuition, fees, and living expenses.
Anyone can be a financial sponsor for an F-1 visa applicant, including relatives, friends, or even organizations. It is not necessary for the sponsor to be a relative, but having a close relationship with the sponsor may make it easier to demonstrate the financial support.
The sponsor will need to provide financial documents, such as bank statements, to show they have sufficient funds to support the student during their stay in the United States. This proof of financial support is required when applying for the F-1 visa and when the student is admitted to a U.S. educational institution.
In addition to financial sponsorship, the student must also be accepted by a U.S. educational institution approved by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Upon acceptance, the school will issue an I-20 form, which the student will need to apply for the F-1 visa.
Remember that having a financial sponsor does not guarantee the approval of an F-1 visa. The U.S. consular officer reviewing the visa application will consider various factors, including the applicant's ties to their home country, their educational background, and their plans after completing their studies in the United States.

Experts Opinion Required!
I have applied for PhD software engineering program in UCI GRE was optional for this program IELTS was not compulsory if sole of instructions was English I did MSCS from szabist so I was eligible as per  Word Education Database (wed). 
I published one conference paper and got accepted journal paper during my MS. 
I am 
surprised why I got rejection from university.

University taken overall more than 1,43000 applications and that means PhD program would got more than 4 thousands applications .
They just saying we nominated candidates on your recommendations, scholarship and documents .

Hello, I hope all are doing great.
I will pay my Sevis Fee in few days. I am just confused between two universities. What do you guys think  is the better option:
1. University of Missouri. National Rank: 220. Total amount of i20 is 50k USD no scholarship .
2. Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. National Rank 400+. Total Cost on i20 after scholarship is 20k USD.
Got 
accepted into Master in Computer Science in both universities. Looking forward to your response. My bank statement is of 90k USD if that matters. TIA

I was rejected for this upcoming fall semester. 
To improve my application, I need to find a good ranked university.
The MS programs I am looking for are
Data science
Data analytics
Business Analytics
Computer science
Unfortunately my CGPA was 2.95. But I have a over 2 years of relevant work experience. Hence looking for names where i can get accepted with the CGPA and without mandatory GRE.
After my research many universities are saying that they might consider, but they usually don't. Had the same experience last term alot of money was wasted on application fees.
I will be very thankful if someone suggest me good universities with good rank for the spring semester.

can anyone give me feedback on my answers for f1 visa interview:
1.1. Why did you choose the USA?
I chose the USA for its high-quality education system, diverse learning environment, ample research and internship opportunities, and access to a strong professional network in the field of public policy.
1.2. Why are you going to the USA?
I am going for my Masters degree in Public Policy at University of Chicago
2. Why University of Chicago?
I chose the University of Chicago for its reputation in the field of public policy, rigorous curriculum, and faculty expertise. I am particularly interested in working with Professor Yana Gallen. Professor Gallen's research and expertise in labor economics and gender wage gap align closely with my interests in addressing social justice issues and promoting equity.
3. Why MPP (Masters of Public Policy) or why did you switch major?
I chose to pursue a Master's degree in Public Policy after realizing the transformative power it holds in addressing social challenges and promoting equity. By shifting my focus from Communication and Design to Public Policy, I aim to develop a comprehensive understanding of policy analysis and implementation, where I can then make meaningful change and advocate for marginalized communities. This aligns with my passion for social justice and my goal of creating a more inclusive and equitable society.
4. How will this study program relate to your past work or studies?
My previous studies and research on the lives of women, children, and marginalized communities, including the transgender community in Pakistan, have provided me with a deep understanding of the challenges they face. This knowledge serves as a foundation for my commitment to addressing these issues through policy reform. By pursuing a Master of Public Policy, I can expand my theoretical and analytical understanding of policy development and utilize evidence-based approaches to propose effective solutions.
5. How many universities have you applied to?
I applied to 5 universities from which I got acceptance from 4.
Arizona State University - Accepted
Georgia State University - Accepted
University of California, Riverside - Accepted
University of Chicago - Accepted
University of Southern California - Rejected
6. Sponsorship Question
Who?
 My Brother
What does he do?
 Works in Google as a software engineer
Annual Income?
 xyz
Lives:
 San Francisco, California
Status:
 LPR - GC Holder
7. When did you graduate?
This month – last week was my graduation ceremony
8. What will you do after graduation?
After graduation, my goal is to return to Pakistan and actively engage in policy development and implementation to address the challenges faced by marginalized communities, particularly the transgender community. I want to work in organizations focused on social justice and policy reform. I want to contribute to the inclusive policy formulation, advocate for the rights of marginalized groups, and work towards creating a just and equitable society in Pakistan.
9. Why not continue your education in your home country?
While I value the education and opportunities available in my home country, pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Chicago offers a unique experience due to its expertise in public policy thus providing me with the necessary skills, knowledge, and networks to make a meaningful impact in the field of public policy.
10. How will you manage cultural and educational differences?
I will manage cultural and educational differences in the US by actively immersing myself in the local culture, building relationships with diverse individuals, seeking support from university resources, actively participating in my studies, and embracing the diversity around me.

Hi everyone.
I got offered to join Masters in Data Science at the University of Connecticut, Storrs, for Fall 2023. I just accepted the offer and paid the enrolment fees. I've been instructed to submit an official transcript and degree diploma/certificate.
As I still need to get my degree and transcript attested by the Higher Education Commission, I fear the documents still count as official and will be accepted.
Further, if anyone is currently enrolled or aiming to join the 
University of Connecticut, please connect to help me with the process as I proceed.
Thanks.

Hi,
I plan to visit USA to attend a conference in March 2023 to present my paper. However, the paper is not yet accepted and I'll get confirmation in January/February. Now if I apply the visa in January, I won't get appointment in such a short time and will miss the event. 
I am wondering if I apply simply a visit visa to USA, and get one priorily. Although I've good travel history for EU, but never been to USA before. So, do you guys think I can get a B1/B2 visa without any 
documentary evidence related to conference in hand.

“ FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANTS TO APPLY FOR USA STUDENT VISA” 
I got all of questions in my inbox regarding US student visa so thought should write here to cater most audience. 
This text is divided into: Expense before and after getting visa, Visa approval and denial etc. 
Firstly, When you start planning to get your degree there are some of the cost you should keep in your mind.  
1: IELTS (40,000) approx
2: University Application Fees ( approx 30,000- 40,000) 
3: SEVIS ($350 -  50,000)
4: WES evaluation ($200 - 35,000) approx
5: Visa fees ( $160 - 29,000) 
Approximately one should have around 200,000 thousands (2 lac) in hand because these all fees are in dollars and varies with exchange rates. 
* THIS IS WHEN YOU ARE APPLYING ON YOUR OWN WITHOUT ANY CONSULTANT* 
Secondly, Visa is all about your luck. I have been rejected once and accepted in my next interview. I have changed nothing in filling out DS-160 for my second interview. It was luck that was with me that day but that doesn’t mean I didnt prepared. 
I prepared infront of mirror, practice to speak because english is our secondary language so to clear my pronunciation and to be confident I practice alot. I did mock interview from youtube. Read interviews of people. Make my own notes and keep changing it until I was fully sure about it. Thats how I manage to speak with confident. No matter if you are saying wrong or incorrect if you have confident you are good to go. 
I have seen people accepting and rejecting and be ready for any decision and if you didnt make it first time make sure that you give your 100% in your second attempt so that you dont have any doubt over yourself. 
People asked me that this amount or that amount is enough for our bank statement. I personaly believe amount should be minimum (50 lac) in your or your sponsor account to match the cost of attendance for your university. 
In my case my uncle was my sponsor. No matter eho is your sponsor make sure to prove the ties with that person in your interview. Make your point strong of wht that person is sponsoring you. Every case is different so make sure you have your point. 
You are allowed to work 20 hours a week on campus as a student. This amount is enough to bear your daily expense but with this amount you cant bear your tuition. Keep this in mind. 
 If you get visa make sure you have enough money for atleast 2- 3 month of your expense here in US. This includes your food, traveling, daily expense etc. 
Belive in yourself and Allah. If he have made you to embassy  so trust me your luck is with yoi because yoi are one in those thousand people who are selected to that university. 
*MY MOM USE TO SAY ME*
“BETA, Agar tumhare naseeb main jana likha hai tou koi rook nahin sakta or nahi likha tou koi cha kar bhe nahin bhej sakta* 
 Please write down your wuestion below in comment I will try my best to answer them. 
Thanks.

I saw that if you are accepted in ucla or any top university you get your visa approved even on the worst interview ever. So is it actually like that? Does the university's credibility matters?

Hello!
Need a favour!
Is printed I-20(computerized signed) accepted for the traveling purpose or do we need to get original hard copy from the university using international courier service which costs around $75?
Kindly answer this query or share your experience, if you have any on it.
Thank you in advance.
