# Student Visa Approval Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the probability of student visa approval based on their credentials. Utilizing data collected from students' Facebook posts about their visa interview experiences, the project employs a neural network to make predictions. The model, which is an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), achieves an 85% accuracy rate on the validation set.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/visa-approval-prediction.git
   cd visa-approval-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage

- Run the data collection script:
  ```bash
  python scripts/data_collection.py
  ```

- To train the model:
  ```bash
  python scripts/train_model.py
  ```

- Deploy the model using Gradio:
  ```bash
  python scripts/deploy_model.py
  ```

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Scraping studentsâ€™ Facebook posts using Python and structuring data with the ChatGPT API.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data using seaborn for insights.
3. **Data Modeling**: Implementing and iterating over neural networks and decision trees; choosing MLP based on F-1 score.
4. **Model Deployment**: The model is deployed using Gradio and hosted on Google Cloud Run.

## Results

The deployed model can be accessed at [muhammadaseem.com/visaprobability](http://muhammadaseem.com/visa). Over 1000 students have used this service, with feedback indicating its utility in improving visa approval chances.
