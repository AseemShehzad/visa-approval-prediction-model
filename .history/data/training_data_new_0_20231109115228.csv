It's difficult to determine the exact reason for visa refusal without knowing the specific details of the case. However, some general tips for improving your chances of getting a visa approval in the next attempt are:

1. Be confident and honest in your answers.
2. Make sure all your documents are complete and up-to-date.
3. Practice your English language skills, especially speaking and listening.
4. Be prepared to explain any discrepancies or mistakes in your application.
5. Show strong ties to your home country, such as family, job, or property ownership.
6. Have a clear plan for your studies and future career goals.
7. Address any concerns raised in the previous interviews, such as the mistake in your address or the reason for choosing a particular university.
8. Consider getting professional help from an immigration lawyer or visa consultant."
